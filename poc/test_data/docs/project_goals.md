We don’t just hop around—this is serious (egg) business. Below are our top goals as we scale the fluffiest logistics operation in the world.

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Deliver 1 Billion Eggs Before Sunrise**
   - Why it matters: The kids are counting on us. Also, chocolate melts in the sun.
   - Success = No child wakes up to an empty basket (or worse, raisins).

2. **Optimize Bunny Hop Route Planning (BHRP)**
   - Why it matters: Every second counts when you have 6.2 million homes per hour.
   - Success = Route so smooth we break land-speed records… again.

3. **Improve Egg Supply Chain**
   - Why it matters: Last year we ran out of glitter eggs. The glitter riots were... unfortunate.
   - Success = Fully stocked egg vault with no need to borrow from Santa.

4. **Expand Global Bunny Workforce**
   - Why it matters: We can't keep working Peter Cottontail double shifts.
   - Success = At least one bunny per time zone, fully trained in stealth and sparkle.

5. **Launch “Easterverse” Mobile App**
   - Why it matters: Kids want to track the Bunny. Adults want coupons.
   - Success = 5-star reviews, zero bugs, and absolutely no GPS on the North Pole.
