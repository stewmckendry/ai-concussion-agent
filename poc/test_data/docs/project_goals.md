# Project Goals: Atlas Knowledge Network (Draft)

## 🎯 Mission

To build an open, decentralized platform that empowers communities to create, share, and evolve structured knowledge using AI and human collaboration.

## 💡 Purpose

Atlas aims to solve the fragmentation of knowledge across documents, teams, and platforms by creating a living, evolving knowledge graph that is:
- **Community-driven**: Every node can be proposed, refined, or challenged by contributors.
- **AI-augmented**: Uses LLMs to recommend links, summarize debates, and clarify contradictions.
- **Structured yet flexible**: Supports both formal logic and soft insights.

## 🔑 Key Outcomes

- A working prototype that visualizes live debates and thought trails
- A GPT-powered “Knowledge Steward” that helps maintain integrity of the graph
- A successful pilot with a civic tech community or university
