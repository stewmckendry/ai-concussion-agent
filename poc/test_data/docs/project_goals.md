# Project Goals (Draft)

We want to use AI to speed up delivery cycles and reduce human bottlenecks. The system should support patch-based thinking and help teams work more asynchronously.

Some goals we've mentioned in past meetings:
- Make it easy for ChatGPT to suggest changes and improvements
- Enable human reviewers to see what's changing and why
- Help people trust AI-generated contributions

> Note: These were rough notes. This doc needs structure and clarity.
