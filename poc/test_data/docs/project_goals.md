## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

1. **Launch Llamas Into Low Earth Orbit**
   - Why it matters: SpaceX has rockets. We have fluff.
   - Success = One small step for man, one giant leap for llama-kind.

2. **Deliver Interplanetary Packages in Under 48 Hours**
   - Why it matters: Mars residents deserve fast shipping too.
   - Success = Zero complaints from Martian customers (and Jeff Bezos).

3. **Develop Space-Grade Saddlepacks**
   - Why it matters: Regular bags just float off.
   - Success = Vacuum-sealed, zero-G-compatible, llama-approved cargo units.

4. **Train Llamas in Zero-G Navigation**
   - Why it matters: Spinning uncontrollably is bad for morale.
   - Success = Llamas can moonwalk (literally) through docking stations.

5. **Secure Galactic Trade Alliance Membership**
   - Why it matters: Interstellar trade isnâ€™t legal without it.
   - Success = Full diplomatic credentialsâ€¦ and maybe a Netflix deal.

Weâ€™re not just changing delivery. Weâ€™re reinventing *alpaca logistics in orbit*.  
Letâ€™s blaze some trails. Or at least, leave hoofprints in the stars. ðŸŒ
