# Project Goals: Atlas Knowledge Network (Draft)

## 🎯 Mission

To build an open, decentralized platform that empowers communities to create, share, and evolve structured knowledge using AI and human collaboration.

## 🧩 Purpose

Atlas aims to solve the fragmentation of knowledge across documents, teams, and platforms by creating a living, evolving knowledge graph that is:

- **Community-driven**: Each node can be proposed, refined, or challenged by contributors.
- **AI-augmented**: Uses LLMs to recommend links, summarize debates, and clarify contradictions.
- **Structured yet flexible**: Supports both formal logic and soft insights.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

- **Decentralized knowledge infrastructure** is essential for digital democracies.
- **Enterprises lose $31B/year** due to inaccessible knowledge—Atlas bridges silos.
- Empowers **communities, researchers, and teams** to think, debate, and evolve ideas together.

## 🧠 AI Role

- Help synthesize ideas into reusable concepts
- Suggest related topics and logical links
- Facilitate Socratic debate between conflicting perspectives

## 🧪 Key Outcomes

- A working prototype that visualizes live debates and thought trails
- A GPT-powered “Knowledge Steward” that helps maintain integrity of the graph
- Successful pilot with a civic tech community or university

## 📈 KPI

- 5 communities onboarded
- 1000+ concepts captured and linked
- 90% user satisfaction with AI reasoning and suggestions
