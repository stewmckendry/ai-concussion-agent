# Project Goals (DRAFT)
This project aims to explore how we can use AI agents and memory-aware tools to build and ship software in a modular, automated way. Our goals include:
- Creating reusable tasks and memory templates
- Enabling dynamic GPT pods to reason from GitHub memory
- Generating useful outputs such as patches, tests, and feedback summaries
- Demonstrating how AI-native delivery can reduce time and cognitive load
