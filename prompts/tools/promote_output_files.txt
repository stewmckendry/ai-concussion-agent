🎯 Task Complete – Prepare Patch Output

The task is now complete. Please follow the instructions below to finalize the output in a format ready for patch promotion.

---

✅ Step 1: Upload Final Output Files

Please zip all finalized output files into a single folder and return the **downloadable link** to the zip file.

Example output:
```
📁 Final Output Files:
- [project_outputs.zip](https://example.com/download/project_outputs.zip)
```

🧠 Step 2: Upload Metadata JSON

Create and return a **downloadable link** for a JSON metadata file that includes the following:

```json
{
  "task_id": "1.1_capture_project_goals",
  "summary": "Capture and describe project goals",
  "output_folders": ["docs"]  #one folder path for each output file
}
```

Example output:
```
📦 Metadata:
- [patch_metadata.json](https://example.com/download/patch_metadata.json)
```

📄 Step 3: Human Instructions (Print These)

Please summarize and print the following for the human user:

1. Where to download and unzip the output files:
   - Save contents of `project_outputs.zip` to:
     ```
     chatgpt_repo/outputs/<folder_path_from_metadata>
     ```
2. Where to save the metadata file:
   - Place `patch_metadata.json` in:
     ```
     .logs/patches/
     ```

3. What to run after saving files:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/generate_patch_from_output.sh
   ```

This will generate a `.diff` and allow the patch to be promoted via PR.
