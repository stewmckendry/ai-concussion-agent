üéØ PROMOTE PATCH ‚Äì EXISTING FILE

You have finalized the updated version of the file: `docs/project_goals.md`.

Please:
1. Compare your updated version to the original version (fetched using `getGitHubFile`)
2. Generate a unified diff in **standard Git format**, using valid syntax:
   - Header lines:
     - `--- a/docs/project_goals.md`
     - `+++ b/docs/project_goals.md`
   - Include a **valid hunk header** like: `@@ -1,5 +1,7 @@`
   - Use `-` to show lines removed, `+` for lines added

‚ùóÔ∏è Avoid malformed lines:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT start lines with `+ -` or `+-`, which will cause patch corruption
- ‚úÖ Instead, write `+ - Item`, `+ * Item`, or quote/escape special lines

‚úÖ Before promoting, test your diff:
- Call the `validate_diff` tool with your diff content to ensure it's valid
- Only proceed if the tool returns `"valid": true`

3. Then call the `promote_patch` tool with:
   - task_id, summary, output_folders, and diff content
4. Provide the human with the resulting download URLs for the diff and metadata files
