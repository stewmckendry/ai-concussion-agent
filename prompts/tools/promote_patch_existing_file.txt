üéØ PROMOTE PATCH ‚Äì EXISTING FILE

You have finalized the updated version of the file: `docs/project_goals.md`.

Please:
1. Compare your updated version to the original version (fetched using `getGitHubFile`)
2. Generate a unified diff in **standard Git format**, using valid syntax:
   - Header lines:
     - `--- a/docs/project_goals.md`
     - `+++ b/docs/project_goals.md`
   - **Hunk header must include line numbers**, like:
     - `@@ -1,5 +1,7 @@` ‚Üê required syntax
   - Use `-` to show lines removed, `+` for lines added
   - Avoid using lines that begin with + - directly after the +. Either add a space, quote the line, or rewrite the list format.
   - Ensure that the diff is clear and easy to read, maintaining proper formatting.
3. Ensure the diff starts with the correct header and contains valid hunks
4. Call the `promote_patch` tool with:
   - task_id
   - summary
   - output_folders
   - diff: (your complete, valid unified diff content)
5. The tool will return:
   - download_url (for .diff file)
   - metadata_url (for .json metadata)
6. Ask the human to download both files and place them in:
   - `.patches/` (diff)
   - `.logs/patches/` (json)
