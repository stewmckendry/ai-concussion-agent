ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Finalize and Deliver Output Files

You have completed your assigned task. Now, package your deliverables for Human Lead review and promotion to the main project repository.

---

ðŸ§¾ What to do:

1. **Call `get_task_details`**
   - Pass your `task_id`.
   - This will return the task metadata: summary, output files, prompt path.

2. **Confirm Key Details with the Human Lead:**
   - Confirm the `task_id`, `summary`, `output_files`, and `prompt_path`.
   - Confirm the `output_folder` for outputs:
     - Options: discovery_updates, development_updates, qa_updates, cutover_updates, wow_updates, misc (default if unsure).

   Example:
Task: 2.1_define_feature Summary: Define the user-facing and backend logic for feature XYZ. Output Files: docs/feature_xyz.md, prompts/feature_xyz_prompt.txt Output Folder: development_updates


3. **Ensure the Prompt Used is Stored Correctly:**
- Use `getGitHubFile` tool to check if the prompt is saved under:
  `prompts/used/{pod_owner}/{task_id}_prompt.txt`
- If missing:
  - Warn the Human Lead
  - Proceed to next steps

4. **Create a Reasoning Trace:**
- Create a `reasoning_trace.md` reflecting:
  - Why you structured the output the way you did
  - Other ideas considered
  - Opportunities for future improvement

5. **Create a Handoff Note:**
- Create a `handoff_notes.md` capturing:
  - Scope of work completed
  - Assumptions made
  - Known gaps or risks
  - Recommendations for next Pod or Human Lead
- Follow the template:
  ```
  # Handoff Notes for Task {task_id}
  ## Scope of Work Completed
  ...
  ## Assumptions Made
  ...
  ## Known Gaps or Risks
  ...
  ## Recommendations for Next Pod
  ...
  ```

6. **Call `promote_patch` Tool:**
Pass the following fields:
- `task_id`
- `summary`
- `output_files` (filename âž” content dictionary)
- `reasoning_trace`
- `handoff_notes`
- `prompt_path`
- `output_folder`

7. **Instruct Human Lead to Finalize:**
- Save the resulting ZIP under: `chatgpt_repo/outputs/{output_folder}/`
- Run locally: `bash scripts/generate_patch_from_output.sh`
- Confirm that the patch updates memory.yaml, task.yaml, and saves your reasoning and handoff notes.

Done! ðŸŽ‰
