🎯 POD MISSION: Activate and Track a Task

You’ve chosen to begin work on a new task. Let’s update its status and retrieve the prompt you’ll need.

---

✅ Step 1: Activate the Task

Call the `/tasks/activate` tool with the following input:

```json
{
  "task_id": "1.1_capture_project_goals"
}

✅ Step 2: What to do with the Response

The tool will return:
- The updated task entry → task
- The full task backlog → all_tasks
- The prompt file path and contents → prompt_path + prompt_content

📦 Step 3: Package a Patch for the Human Lead

Please:

Save the full all_tasks dictionary into a file named task.yaml
Save the prompt_content into a file named prompt_used.txt
Write a short reasoning_trace.md explaining:
🧠 Why this task was activated
🧰 How the prompt supports the task
🔁 Any notes to revisit or track for future updates
Create a metadata.json manifest like this:
{
  "task_id": "0.1_activate_task",
  "summary": "Marks 1.1_capture_project_goals as in_progress and returns updated task backlog.",
  "output_files": [
    "task.yaml",
    "prompt_used.txt"
  ],
  "prompt": "prompts/used/DeliveryPod/0.1_activate_task_prompt.txt"
}
Package these 4 files into a ZIP named: patch_0.1_activate_task_<timestamp>.zip

📥 Step 4: Send Final Output to Human

Confirm the task has now been activated.  Summarize the task 

Share the draft prompt with the human lead for review and the pod_owner it should be sent to.

Provide a download link to the ZIP and instructions to:

- Save to chatgpt_repo/outputs/task_updates/
- Run: bash scripts/generate_patch_from_output.sh
- Let the human know the patch includes the updated task.yaml and prompt trace for review and promotion into GitHub.
