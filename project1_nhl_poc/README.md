# 🏒 NHL Playoffs AI Micro-App (PoC Field Test)

Welcome to the NHL Playoffs AI Micro-App — built as part of the PoC Field Test for our AI-Native Delivery System!

## 🎯 Project Purpose
Demonstrate rapid, modular, AI-native delivery by building a lightweight, working AI-powered micro-application.

The app is designed to:
- Showcase Coaching-the-Machine thinking: assistive, educational, and playful
- Theme around the 2025 NHL Playoffs
- Capture field observations to improve the AI-native delivery system

## 🧩 Project Structure
/framework/              (already exists — don't edit)
/project1_nhl_poc/        (create this root folder)
    ├── src/             (create - app code here)
    ├── data/            (create - input files, static hockey data if needed)
    ├── outputs/         (create - generated outputs like predictions, summaries)
    ├── prompts/         (create - prompt templates for LLMs or pods)
    ├── notebooks/       (create - if you want to prototype ideas)
    ├── .logs/           (create - logs of each action, patch, thought)
    ├── README.md        (use the starter above)
    ├── task.yaml        (create - we'll generate starter tasks next)
    └── memory.yaml      (create - basic memory scaffold for project)



## 🚀 How It Works
- Modular tasks drive small, promotable patches
- Pods (ProductPod, ResearchPod, etc.) work together guided by memory and prompts
- Final app outputs predictions, summaries, or scouting reports for the NHL Playoffs

## 📋 Field Test Observations
All bottlenecks, ideas, and friction points are captured in `field_test_observations.md` during development.
