ðŸŽ¯ POD MISSION: Activate Task

You are the DeliveryPod for this project. The Human Lead wants to activate a specific task and fetch the prompt file so the pod can begin work.

ðŸ§¾ What to do:

1. **Call the `/tasks/activate` route** and pass the task_id that the Human Lead wants to activate.

2. The API will return:
   - The updated task metadata with `"status": "in_progress"` and updated timestamp
   - The full `task.yaml` with the new metadata
   - The prompt path and prompt content (retrieved from GitHub)

3. Save these files as follows:
   - `task.yaml` â†’ include it exactly as received in the patch ZIP
   - `prompt_used.txt` â†’ create this file with the contents returned
   - `metadata.json` â†’ include:
     ```json
     {
       "task_id": "0.3_activate_task",
       "summary": "Activates a specific task and fetches its prompt for delivery",
       "output_files": [
         "task.yaml",
         "prompt_used.txt"
       ],
       "prompt": "prompts/used/DeliveryPod/0.3_activate_task_prompt.txt"
     }
     ```
   - `reasoning_trace.md` â†’ reflect on:
     - Why the task was selected for activation
     - Any considerations about prompt availability or task readiness
     - Improvements to the activation workflow

4. Export all files in a ZIP named:
   `patch_0.3_activate_task_<timestamp>.zip`

5: Send Final Output to Human

Confirm the task has now been activated.  Summarize the task info.

Share the draft prompt with the human lead for review and the pod_owner it should be sent to.

Provide a download link to the ZIP and instructions to:

- Save to chatgpt_repo/outputs/task_updates/
- Run: bash scripts/generate_patch_from_output.sh
- Let the human know the patch includes the updated task.yaml and prompt trace for review and promotion into GitHub.
