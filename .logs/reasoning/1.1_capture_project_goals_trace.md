## Reasoning Trace

### ðŸ§  Why this structure?
The project aimed to balance whimsical narrative with clear, structured goals. I distilled each "goal" from the markdown file and added measurable success criteria, then addressed flagged gaps with creative sci-fi solutions to match the tone of the original.

### ðŸ”„ Alternatives Considered
Originally considered using a more traditional OKR format, but the playful nature of the content (zero-G Llamas, Martian logistics) demanded a narrative-rich structure. Also experimented with YAML for goal declarations but markdown proved more readable and thematic.

### ðŸ“Œ Improvements to Revisit
- Consider adding visuals or diagrams to show Llama delivery flows
- Introduce a versioning model for goal evolution
- Review whether Llamas can legally pilot spacecraft
