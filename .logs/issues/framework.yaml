  title: Memory index returns misleading message
  detail: When running /memory/manage with action=index, the tool returns 'Memory
    indexed with X entries' regardless of changes. In a case with no src/ folder,
    the message said 38 entries indexed, but those were pre-existing. It should reflect
    actual indexing results.
