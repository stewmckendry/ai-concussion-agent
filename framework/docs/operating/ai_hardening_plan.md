# 🔐 Hardening the AI-Native Delivery Framework

## 🧠 For Technical Users

You’ve built a powerful and flexible prototype. But to make it production-grade, we need to harden every layer — from Git to APIs to GPT access.

### 🧪 INDIVIDUAL USE — What a Developer or Pod Owner Should Do

| Area | Risk / Weakness | What You Should Do |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| GitOps | Writing directly to main with a PAT token | ✅ Use feature branches + PR reviews <br> ✅ Use GitHub App or deploy keys |
| Tool Access | All GPT Pods can call all tools | ✅ Tag tools by sensitivity (e.g., read-only, destructive) <br> ✅ Add RBAC |
| Logging | Only reasoning + changelog logs; no access logs | ✅ Log tool usage per Pod/task with timestamps |
| Prompt Drift | Prompts can evolve without traceability | ✅ Log every `prompt_used.txt` per task <br> ✅ Add prompt versioning metadata |
| Memory Indexing | Manual or inconsistent | ✅ Automate memory updates in `commit_and_log` + use semantic diff tools |
| Secrets | Exposing personal access tokens (PAT) in scripts | ✅ Use `.env` files, secret managers, or GitHub Actions encrypted secrets |
| Data | Sensitive files may be committed without notice | ✅ Add metadata flags (e.g., `contains_PII`) and content scanning |

### 🏢 ORGANIZATIONAL USE — What IT + Engineering Teams Should Do

| Area | Risk / Limitation | Hardened Practice |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| FastAPI Auth | APIs open beyond token | 🔒 Add OAuth2, JWT, or service account auth |
| API Versioning | No formal versioning of tool endpoints | 🧩 Add `/v1/tasks/start`, `/v2/tasks/complete`, etc. |
| GPT Tool RBAC | Every Pod gets every tool | 🛠️ Use config-based allowlists per Pod role |
| GitHub Access | Centralized token; no identity separation | 🧰 Use GitHub App or scoped service accounts |
| Prompt Governance | No way to enforce or review sensitive prompts | 👁️ Create `prompts/` review board + approval pipeline |
| Audit + Traceability | Logs are present, but unstructured | 📊 Route logs to structured store (e.g., ELK, CloudWatch, Splunk) |
| Fail-Safe + Monitoring | No retry, fallback, or alerting | 🚨 Add `/logs/errors`, retry wrappers, and critical tool monitors |
| Observability | No runtime dashboard | 📈 Add Prometheus/Grafana or call `/metrics/summary` nightly |

### 💡 BONUS: Infra-Ready Extensions

- Use Docker + K8s to containerize each GPT Pod and tool layer
- Deploy per environment (dev / test / prod) with config switching
- Build task + memory viewers for business users with Streamlit or Dash

## 🤝 For Non-Technical Users

If your team or organization is planning to use this system, here’s what you need to understand and support.

### 👤 INDIVIDUAL USERS — What You Can Do

| Risk | What It Means for You | What You Can Do |
|------|------------------------|------------------|
| No approval before GPT acts | A GPT might take action without human review | ✅ Check the task status and outputs before you approve |
| Tools not restricted | GPT might send messages, write files, or make calls | ✅ Ask your team what tools your Pod is allowed to use |
| No logs or audit | You can’t see who did what or when | ✅ Look for the `changelog.yaml` and `prompt_used.txt` |
| No Git history | Files may change without explanation | ✅ Only use branches with peer review and tracking |

---

### 🏢 ORGANIZATIONS — What Leaders and IT Should Support

| Concern | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| No access control | Any GPT can do anything | ✅ Define what GPTs should be allowed to do per role |
| No approval workflow | Work may be done without review | ✅ Require approvals on critical outputs |
| No standard logging | You can’t trace what happened | ✅ Ensure logs are stored, timestamped, and reviewed |
| Unprotected data in Git | GPTs may access personal or private info | ✅ Mark sensitive files, and review before memory indexing |
| Too many tools, too fast | Hard to control what the system can do | ✅ Define allowed tools for your department or unit |
| No disaster plan or fallback | If GPT fails or errors, there’s no recovery | ✅ Build in backups, rollback plans, and human checkpoints |

## 🔧 What “Hardening” Really Means

It’s how we move from:
> “This is a cool demo”

to:
> “This is a reliable system we trust for real work.”

It’s the difference between:
- **Experiment ➝ Platform**
- **Playground ➝ Production**
- **Assistant ➝ Teammate**
