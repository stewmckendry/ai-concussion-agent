# 📓 AI-Native Delivery Framework: Phase 2 Enhancements (April 2025)

## 📊 Purpose

This document captures the next evolution of the AI-Native Delivery System, focused on reducing friction, improving traceability, and accelerating project execution for the NHL Predictor PoC and future AI-native projects.

The goal is to build upon the strong foundations already in place, enhancing the system to be more seamless, automated, repeatable, and auditable.

---

# 🔢 Why Are We Enhancing the Framework?

| Problem | Impact |
|:--------|:-------|
| Too many manual steps | Slows delivery, introduces errors |
| Rigid promote_patch after every micro-task | Overhead, no batching |
| Fragile prompt handling | Blockers when prompts missing |
| Poor chain-of-thought capture | No visibility into how Pods reasoned |
| Manual reasoning traces and handoffs | High human burden |
| Risky memory.yaml drift | Sync issues without structure |


---

# ✨ Future State Vision

| Area | Future Behavior | Outcome |
|:-----|:----------------|:--------|
| Task execution | Activate → auto-update → auto-commit | Fast, fluid task progress |
| Prompt management | Auto-draft prompts, auto-store and commit prompts | No blockers, full traceability |
| Reasoning trace | Auto-generate reasoning aligned with metrics framework | Full auditability, structured reasoning |
| Git commits | Auto-commit major lifecycle updates | Clean history, no micromanagement |
| Promote_patch | Batch promote only meaningful milestones | Strategic, lightweight promotions |
| Chain of Thought | Append reasoning evolution automatically | Human-AI collaboration visible |
| Changelog | Central CHANGELOG.md updated automatically | Clear audit trails |
| Handoff notes | Auto-generate and appendable per task | Seamless Pod transitions |
| Metrics | Integrated reasoning capture, CoT linkage | Improved system learning |
| Project initialization | Repo setup + framework standardization automated | Fast, consistent starting point |


---

# 🔧 Implementation Plan

## 📊 New FastAPI Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `/project/init_project` | Create + initialize new project repo |
| `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` | Append to chain of thought file |
| `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` | Auto-commit minor updates to Git |
| `/tasks/append_handoff_note/{task_id}` | Append or create handoff note |
| `/tasks/append_changelog` | Auto-update CHANGELOG.md entries |


## 📊 OpenAPI Schema Updates

- `/tasks/activate` → Document smart prompt fallback
- Add schemas for new endpoints above
- Confirm promote_patch aligns to new batch promotion logic


## 📊 New Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| `scripts/structure_repo.py` | Set up repo scaffolding for projects |
| `scripts/auto_commit.py` | Auto-commit minor updates |
| `scripts/append_chain_of_thought.py` | Append step notes to chain of thought files |
| `scripts/append_handoff_note.py` | Auto-create or update handoff notes |
| `scripts/append_changelog.py` | Add structured entries to CHANGELOG.md |


## 📊 Prompt and Template Updates

| Item | Change |
|:-----|:------|
| DeliveryPod system prompt | Auto-call append_chain_of_thought at key events |
| Project templates | Add `/outputs/`, `/scripts/`, `/templates/` directories |
| Reasoning trace | Align with structured format for metrics capture |


## 📊 Memory.yaml / Task.yaml Updates

- Link `prompt_used.txt`, `reasoning_trace.md`, `cot.md`, and `handoff.md` to each task if available
- Track `project_init_trace` for project initialization steps


## 📊 Auto-Commit Logic

| Event | Auto-Commit? |
|:------|:------------|
| Task activated | ✅ |
| Task completed | ✅ |
| Prompt drafted due to missing file | ✅ |
| Reasoning trace updated | ✅ |
| Chain of thought appended | ✅ |
| Handoff note updated | ✅ |
| Minor metadata tweak | ❌ (batch later)


## 📊 Chain of Thought Capture

- Chain of thought file `/outputs/task_updates/{task_id}/cot_{task_id}.md`
- Appended automatically at key reasoning events (activation, updates, pivots)


## 📊 Prompt Management

- Auto-draft missing prompts during `/tasks/activate`
- Auto-save prompts to correct path and commit
- Link prompt to memory.yaml


## 📊 Reasoning Trace Management

- Auto-generate reasoning trace aligned with metrics framework
- Use chain of thought log to enrich reasoning trace
- Save under `/outputs/task_updates/{task_id}/reasoning_trace.md`


## 📊 Changelog Management

- Central `CHANGELOG.md` updated automatically
- Every tool that commits changes will also append a structured entry to the changelog.
- Avoid using separate explicit API calls; integrate changelog updates directly into tool handlers for best practice.


## 📊 Handoff Notes

- Auto-generate `.logs/handoff/{task_id}_handoff.md` per task
- Allow appending via GPT or Human Lead
- Linked optionally in memory.yaml


## 📊 Promote_Patch Best Practices

- Human Lead triggers promote_patch after logical milestones (e.g., finish Discovery Phase)
- promote_patch bundles updates, generates changelog, and creates PR


## 📊 Auto-Commit Upgrades to Existing Routes

| Route | Enhancement |
|:------|:------------|
| `/tasks/activate` | After updating task status, save prompt if missing, auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/create` | After creating new task, auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/update_metadata/{task_id}` | If significant fields updated (done, prompt, etc.), auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/clone` | After cloning, auto-commit updated `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/memory/index` | After reindexing, auto-commit `memory.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/memory/add` | After adding new memory entries, auto-commit `memory.yaml`, append to changelog |

# 🚀 End-to-End Examples

## A) Project Initialization
**Human Lead:**
- Triggers `/project/init_project` with repo details and project metadata.

**GPT Pod Tools:**
- Scaffold repo structure.
- Fetch or create `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml`.
- Capture and save initial prompt and reasoning.
- Auto-commit to GitHub (`chatgpt/auto/init_project`).


## B) Discovery Tasks (1.1 Capture Goals, 1.2 User Flows)
**GPT Pod:**
- Calls `/tasks/activate` for each task.
- Auto-drafts missing prompt if needed.
- Captures prompt_used.txt, reasoning_trace.md, and appends to cot.md.
- Auto-commits "in_progress" and "done" status changes.

**Human Lead:**
- Monitors Pod output.
- Optionally reviews and updates drafts.
- After multiple tasks complete, calls `promote_patch` manually to formalize batch updates.


## C) Development Tasks (2.1 Design, 2.2 Build Feature)
**GPT Pod:**
- Activates each development task via `/tasks/activate`.
- Produces designs, code, documentation.
- Captures full prompt/reasoning trace automatically.
- Auto-commits after meaningful deliverables.

**Human Lead:**
- Reviews outputs as needed.
- Ensures logical batches (e.g., full feature) before triggering `promote_patch`.

# 🔧 Thoughts and Confirmations

✅ This model will:
- Implement foundational enhancements progressively.

- Deliver both the framework AND the NHL PoC app working seamlessly.

✅ Every major SDLC phase will be tested and verified before moving forward.

✅ Risk is minimized by validating at each phase rather than all at once.


# 🚀 Working Approach

Each batch will be implemented using this workflow:
1. Human Lead says "Start next batch."
2. GPT provides overview: changes, outcomes, required inputs/files, assumptions.
3. Human Lead provides inputs/files.
4. GPT generates and prints patches.
5. Human Lead applies patches, tests, and reports back.

This ensures clear communication, clean implementation, and real-world validation.


# 📦 Updated Batch 1: Project Initialization Phase — Kickoff

## 📊 Overview of Changes

We are implementing the project initialization foundation so that:

- A new project repo can be instantly scaffolded.
- Initial project metadata (prompt, reasoning) is captured.
- Git auto-commit happens after initializing core files (`task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`).
- We set up a clean, repeatable project structure.
- Ensure both `/framework/` and `/project/` directories exist.
- Copy required `/framework/` files into `/project/` to bootstrap the new repo correctly.

## 🎯 Why Are We Doing This?

- Eliminate manual repo setup.
- Ensure every project starts with full traceability and full system capabilities.
- Accelerate project boot-up time.
- Ensure all future Pods are operating from a standardized, ready repo.

## 🌟 Outcomes Expected

- `/project/init_project` FastAPI route fully functional.
- Repo scaffold with `/framework/`, `/project/outputs/`, `/scripts/`, `/templates/`.
- Framework files copied to project repo as needed.
- Initial `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` created (or verified).
- Initial reasoning trace and prompt captured and committed.
- Repo state is clean, organized, and ready for Discovery tasks.

## 🗂️ Existing Files Needed

To implement Batch 1, I will need from you:

- ✅ `main.py` (current FastAPI server code — you uploaded earlier)
- ✅ `openapi.json` (current schema — uploaded earlier)
- 📂 Template folder structure you want (or confirm "use default"):
  - `/framework/`
  - `/project/outputs/`
  - `/scripts/`
  - `/templates/`
- 📋 Template `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` to use if none exist (or say "draft starter templates")
- 📜 Baseline system prompt text for project initialization (or say "draft starter prompt")

## 📜 Assumptions

- We are working inside a GitHub repo already created externally.
- API has access to PyGitHub authenticated client.
- Repo permissions allow file creation and commits.
- If `/framework/` folder is missing, `/project/init_project` will halt and warn.
- Default framework files will be copied automatically to the `/project/` side for starting point if missing.
- No need for immediate pull request on init — just commit directly to `chatgpt/auto/init_project`.

## 🛎️ Ready for you to:

✅ Confirm or upload:

1. Template folder structure (or "use default")
2. Starter `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` (or "draft starter")
3. Project init system prompt (or "draft starter")

Then, I'll generate the patches! 🚀

When you're ready, just reply with your inputs! 🎯


# 📣 Batch 1 Kickoff — Initialize the Project

## 🏁 Overview

In this batch, we will implement end-to-end project initialization so that:

- We can cleanly initialize a new project repo.
- We copy required framework baseline files into the project folder structure.
- We capture initial project metadata (context, goals, strategy).
- We commit the initialized structure to GitHub under a clean branch (`chatgpt/auto/init_project`).

This is the very first step before we can kick off any SDLC tasks (Discovery, Development, Testing, Go-live).

## 🏗️ Changes to Implement

| Change | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/project/init_project` FastAPI route | To orchestrate project setup |
| Repo renaming (`ai-delivery-framework` → `ai-delivery-framework`) | To accurately reflect that it's the framework |
| Create new repo for NHL Predictor app | Separation of framework vs project |
| Auto-copy `/framework/` files if missing | Ensure project starts with full framework baseline |
| Initialize clean `/project/` folder | Structure organized clearly |
| Create starter `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml` from provided templates | Enable task tracking |
| Draft and store initialization prompt | Capture "Why are we starting this project?" |
| Draft and store initialization reasoning trace | Capture "How was this set up?" |
| Commit changes to GitHub | Full traceability of initial setup |

## 📄 Files You Provided (✅)

- `main.py` (FastAPI backend)
- `openapi.json` (Custom GPT tool schema)
- `task.yaml` (Standard task template)
- `memory_stub.yaml` (Memory starter)

✅ This covers everything needed for the coding!

## ✍️ Starter Prompt for Project Initialization

🧠 **Project Initialization Prompt: NHL Playoff Predictor PoC**

**Context**: We are building an AI-native NHL Playoff Predictor application as a Proof of Concept.  
**Objective**: Capture project goals, flows, architecture, experiments, and delivery traceability using the AI Delivery Framework.  
**Scope**: Start from Discovery (defining goals and user flows), through Development (building features), into E2E Testing and Go-live.  
**Pods Involved**: DevPod, QAPod, DeliveryPod, WoWPod, Human Lead.  
**Deliverable**: A working AI application + proof of enhanced AI-native delivery methods.

## 🔵 Assumptions (✅ Confirmed)

| Assumption | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repo already exists for Framework (`ai-delivery-framework`) | ✅ Yes (will rename) |
| Repo exists or will create new for NHL Predictor | ✅ New repo needed |
| PyGitHub token available and working | ✅ Confirmed |
| Permissions to create files/commit | ✅ Confirmed |
| `/framework/` folder is mandatory for setup | ✅ Yes |
| Default framework files copied if missing | ✅ Yes |
| No pull request needed on init (direct commit) | ✅ Yes |

## 🛠️ Next Steps — Batch 1 Coding Plan

Now that you provided everything:

✅ **Step 1**: I will generate a new `/project/init_project` FastAPI route.  
✅ **Step 2**: It will:
- Check and copy framework files
- Create the `/project/` baseline
- Store `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, initial prompt and reasoning
- Auto-commit to `chatgpt/auto/init_project`
✅ **Step 3**: I'll show you the patches to apply.

## ⚡ Quick Recap: Why Do It This Way?

| Reason | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Eliminate manual repo setup | Faster start for all projects |
| Standardize structure | Fewer mistakes, easier scaling |
| Capture project context from the beginning | Full traceability |
| Automate commit history | Trustable source of truth |
| Clean framework vs project separation | Maintainable for long term |

## ✅ Ready to Start Batch 1?

If yes, I'll proceed to:

- Start generating the `/project/init_project` route
- Print code patches for you
- Hand over for you to apply and test 🎯

# ✍️ Summary of New FastAPI Route

## POST `/project/init_project`

### 📥 Inputs

- `repo_name`: Name of GitHub repo to initialize (string)
- `project_name`: Name for project folder under `/project/` (string)
- `project_description`: Human-readable description (string)

### ⚙️ Actions

- Validate `/framework/` folder exists in the repo.
- Create `/project/{project_name}/` structure:
  - `outputs/`
  - `scripts/`
  - `templates/`
- Copy necessary `/framework/` templates/files into project side.
- Create starter `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml` if missing.
- Capture project initialization prompt and reasoning trace.
- Auto-commit all changes to `chatgpt/auto/init_project` branch.


# 🛠️ 2. Manual Actions Outside Code

To fully implement Batch 1 successfully, you will need to:

| Task | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rename the `ai-concussion-agent` repo → `ai-delivery-framework` | This will officially establish it as the framework repo |
| Create new repo: `nhl-predictor` (or similar) | This will be the PoC project repo |
| Confirm both repos have `/framework/` folder | It must exist and have baseline templates |
| Confirm GitHub PAT has access to new repos | (Should be true if using the same token) |
| After repo rename, adjust any hardcoded repo names if needed | (We'll check together if needed after rename) |

# 📋 3. What’s Left for Full Project Initialization (per Future State Vision)

| Item | Status | Planned Batch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Auto-capture initialization Chain of Thought | ❌ Not done yet | Batch 2 (Discovery Phase Enhancements) |
| Auto-capture `reasoning_trace.md` during project init | ✅ Simple version done (expand later) | Expand in Batch 2 |
| `memory.yaml` linking to project context (`project_init_trace`) | ❌ Not yet | Batch 2 |
| Auto-commit to a structured branch (`chatgpt/auto/init_project`) | ✅ Done |  |
| Create human onboarding prompt/template for new project | ❌ Future optional | Batch 6 (System Polish) |
| Add rollback strategy if init fails mid-way | ❌ Future optional | Batch 6 (System Polish) |

# ✅ Quick Recap

- Batch 1 covers basic project setup and framework copying.
- Minor auto-capture (prompt, reasoning) already done in basic form.
- We'll enrich traceability (Chain of Thought, project context links) in **Batch 2** and polish further in **Batch 6**.


# 🔢 Folder Restructuring Plan for Framework and PoC Projects

## 📂 Framework Repo (`ai-delivery-framework`)

| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/framework/` | Core templates, reusable system files (extracted from `task_templates`, `prompts`, `scripts`) |
| `/docs/` | System overview, operations, guides, roadmap |
| `/scripts/` | Shared automation scripts (e.g., `generate_patch`, `init_repo`) |
| `/prompts/` | Templates and archives of used prompts |
| `/task_templates/` | Task blueprints organized by SDLC phase |
| `/` (root files) | `main.py`, `openapi.json`, `requirements.txt`, `task.yaml` (template), `memory.yaml` (stub), `README.md`, `.env`, `.gitignore` |

---

## 📂 PoC Project Repo (`nhl-predictor`)

| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/project/data/` | Raw input data, datasets, seed files |
| `/project/notebooks/` | Jupyter notebooks for analysis, prototyping |
| `/project/outputs/` | Task outputs (`prompt_used`, `reasoning_traces`, `handoff notes`) |
| `/project/src/client/` | Frontend code (UI) |
| `/project/src/server/` | Backend server code (APIs) |
| `/project/src/utils/` | Shared utilities/helpers |

| `/project/docs/` | Project-specific documentation, API docs |
| `/project/logs/` | System logs, debugging outputs |
| `/project/test/` | Unit tests, integration tests |
| `/framework/` | (Copied from framework baseline at init) |
| `/` (root files) | `README.md`, `task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, `.gitignore` |

---

### 🔵 Notes

- `/framework/` in PoC repo will be **static copies** — refreshed manually if needed.
- `/project/` contains **active, growing project-specific work products**.

---

# 🔹 Bash Script for Repo Rename and New Repo Creation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Rename existing repo (manual via GitHub Web UI advised)
echo "Please manually rename 'ai-delivery-framework' to 'ai-delivery-framework' via GitHub settings."
echo "\nWaiting 10 seconds for you to complete..."
sleep 10

# Create new PoC repo
NEW_REPO_NAME="nhl-predictor"
USER="stewmckendry"

# Use GitHub CLI (gh) to create repo
if gh repo view $USER/$NEW_REPO_NAME > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Repo $NEW_REPO_NAME already exists. Skipping creation."
else
  echo "Creating new repo: $NEW_REPO_NAME"
  gh repo create $USER/$NEW_REPO_NAME --public --confirm
fi

# Clone locally if needed
echo "\nTo clone locally:"
echo "git clone https://github.com/$USER/$NEW_REPO_NAME.git"

```

✅ Save as: `scripts/init_repos.sh`
✅ Make executable: `chmod +x scripts/init_repos.sh`

(Note: Assumes you have `gh` (GitHub CLI) installed and authenticated.)


---

# 🚀 Ready to proceed!

Now you can:
- Apply openapi.json patch
- Run repo rename and setup
- Test `/project/init_project`

Then report back for results and next steps!

---

# 📂 Framework Copy Guidelines

## Should It Be in `/framework/`?

| Should It Be in `/framework/`? | Type of File | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ Yes | Templates, reusable task packs, prompt templates, memory stubs, core shared scripts | Reusable assets meant to start any project |
| ✅ Yes | API/Plugin Integration Prompts | Prompts that power tooling (`gpt_tools` prompts) |
| ❌ No | Project-specific data, outputs, logs, test results | Tied to a specific project or PoC |
| ❌ No | POC-specific README, project-specific prompts | Only move generalized docs, not project deliverables |
| ❌ No | `.logs/`, `.gitkeep`, `.DS_Store` | Internal build artifacts or MacOS noise files |
| ❌ No | ChatGPT repo outputs, patch zips | Deliverable outputs specific to PoC sessions |
| ❌ No | Test data, project-specific notebooks/scripts | Stay in project repos like `nhl-predictor/` |

---

## 📋 Specific Examples from Your File List

| File(s) | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/task_templates/Phase*/` folders | ✅ Copy to `/framework/task_templates/` |
| `/prompts/gpt_tools/*.txt` | ✅ Copy to `/framework/prompts/gpt_tools/` |
| `/scripts/generate_patch_from_output.sh`, `promote_patch.sh`, `init_repo.sh` | ✅ Copy to `/framework/scripts/` |

| `/task.yaml` (framework version) | ✅ Copy to `/framework/task.yaml` |
| `/main.py`, `/openapi.json`, `/requirements.txt` | ❌ Stays at repo root — needed for FastAPI app, not per-project |
| `/docs/overview/*.md` | ✅ Copy useful overview docs into `/framework/docs/overview/` |
| `/docs/system/*.md` | ✅ Copy system-level documents to `/framework/docs/system/` |
| `/docs/roadmap/*.md` | ✅ Copy into `/framework/docs/roadmap/` |
| `/docs/guides/*.md` | ✅ Copy onboarding/setup guides to `/framework/docs/guides/` |
| `/project1_nhl_poc/`, `/test_data/`, `/poc/test_cases/` | ❌ These are project-specific: DO NOT move into framework |
| `/poc/ChatGPT_Git/*.md` test result files | ❌ Stay archived separately if you want (not framework) |
| `.logs/`, `chatgpt_repo/outputs/`, `.DS_Store` | ❌ Ignore — don't copy to framework |

---

# 🚀 In Short:

- ✅ Framework is for **starting any future project fast and clean**.
- ✅ Project-specific deliverables and test data **stay out of the framework repo**.

# 🛎️ Reminder

When you run `/project/init_project`, it copies this `/framework/` into the new project repo under `/framework/` automatically — ready for the Pod to get working.

# 🛠️ Update on Batch 1 Progress

## ✅ What’s Completed

1. Renamed `ai-concussion-agent` repo to `ai-delivery-framework`, synced with local repo, and updated file references.
2. Re-organized files in `ai-delivery-framework` per the new repo structure.
3. Ran `init_repo.sh` to create new `nhl-predictor` GitHub repo.

---

# 🛠️ 1. Setup Local Folder for New NHL Predictor Repo

Now that the `nhl-predictor` repo is created on GitHub, you should:

```bash
# Navigate to your projects folder
cd /Users/liammckendry/Projects/

# Create project standard folders
mkdir -p project/data
mkdir -p project/notebooks
mkdir -p project/outputs/project_init
mkdir -p project/src/client
mkdir -p project/src/server
mkdir -p project/src/utils
mkdir -p project/src/scripts
mkdir -p project/docs
mkdir -p project/logs
mkdir -p project/test

# Also create empty /framework/ folder to be filled later by /project/init_project
mkdir -p framework

# Touch basic placeholder files if necessary
touch project/outputs/.gitkeep

# Clone the new repo
git clone https://github.com/stewmckendry/nhl-predictor.git

# Move into the project folder
cd nhl-predictor
```

✅ You should now have a clean, empty `nhl-predictor/` project folder locally — ready for `/project/init_project`.

---

# 🔥 2. What You Still Need to Do to Complete Batch 1

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Confirm local clone is clean | `git status` inside `nhl-predictor/` should show a clean, empty repo |
| Run `/project/init_project` via your FastAPI app | Inputs:<br>- `repo_name='nhl-predictor'`<br>- `project_name='NHL Predictor'`<br>- `project_description='Proof of concept NHL playoff outcome predictor.'` |
| Verify post-init project structure | Check that `/framework/`, `/project/outputs/`, `/project/scripts/`, etc., were properly created |
| Verify auto-commit happened | Check GitHub: repo should have a new commit (`chatgpt/auto/init_project` branch or similar) with init files |
| Confirm reasoning trace + prompt_used.txt | Check `/project/outputs/project_init/` for generated trace files |
| Manual review | - Framework files copied ✔️<br>- Project folders created ✔️<br>- Minor files like `memory.yaml`, `task.yaml` are present ✔️ |

---

# 📋 Quick Validation Checklist

| Item | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repo cloned locally | ✅ |
| `/framework/` copied into repo | ✅ |
| `/project/outputs/`, `/scripts/`, `/templates/` created | ✅ |
| `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` exist at project root | ✅ |
| `prompt_used.txt` and `reasoning_trace.md` generated in `outputs/project_init/` | ✅ |
| GitHub commit created with init changes | ✅ |

---

# ⚡ Quick Reminder

✅ **Batch 1** covers:
- Initial project setup
- Framework copy
- Auto-initial commit

❌ **Deferred to later batches**:
- Chain of Thought enrichment
- Project context linking to `memory.yaml`
- Deeper Discovery phase artifacts

---

# 🛠️ FAQs About `/project/init_project`

---

## 1. Which Repo Does `/project/init_project` Affect?

✅ **Answer**: It creates files/folders inside the `nhl-predictor` repo.

- Even though the FastAPI app (`main.py`) lives in the `ai-delivery-framework` repo, it is programmed to operate on the project repo based on the `repo_name` or `project_path` you pass.
- Think of `ai-delivery-framework` as the **"central brain"** managing multiple projects.

---

## 2. Where Should `main.py` and `openapi.json` Live?

✅ **Answer**: They stay in the `ai-delivery-framework` repo.

- `ai-delivery-framework` is your **core platform**.
- It holds all:
  - FastAPI routes
  - Framework templates
  - System prompts
  - Future tools
- Project repos like `nhl-predictor/` stay **very clean and lightweight** — only project-specific files, **no FastAPI app**, **no OpenAPI spec** inside them.

---

## 3. How Do You Call `/project/init_project`?

✅ **Answer**: You call `/project/init_project` from a **Custom GPT** (like DeliveryPod) or manually.

- **Update your GPT’s** `openapi.json` schema to include the `/project/init_project` route if not already done.
- Alternatively, **manually** call it using:
  - `curl`
  - Postman
  - Swagger UI (e.g., [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) if running FastAPI locally)

---

## 4. Starter Prompt for GPT to Initiate the Project

✅ **Here’s a clean starter prompt:**

### 🚀 Starter Prompt for DeliveryPod

> 🎯 **POD MISSION: Initialize a New Project Repository**  
> We are kicking off a new AI-Native Delivery project.
> 
> **Project Name**: NHL Predictor  
> **Repository Name**: nhl-predictor  
> **Project Description**: Proof of concept NHL playoff outcome predictor.
>
> **🛠️ Instructions:**
> - Call the `/project/init_project` endpoint.
> - Pass the fields:
>   - `repo_name = 'nhl-predictor'`
>   - `project_name = 'NHL Predictor'`
>   - `project_description = 'Proof of concept NHL playoff outcome predictor.'`
> - After initialization, confirm:
>   - `/framework/` folder has been copied.
>   - `/project/` folders (`outputs`, `scripts`, etc.) exist.
>   - `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml` are present.
>   - `prompt_used.txt` and `reasoning_trace.md` are created under `/project/outputs/project_init/`.

🚀 **Goal**: Setup a fully initialized project workspace ready for AI-native delivery.

---

# 📋 Recap of Confirmations

| Topic | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| Which repo gets init? | `nhl-predictor` |
| Where does `main.py` live? | `ai-delivery-framework` |
| Where is `openapi.json` updated? | `ai-delivery-framework` |
| Who calls init? | DeliveryPod GPT or manual API test |
| Is starter prompt ready? | ✅ Yes — see above |

---

# 🚀 Final Prep Before Running `/project/init_project`

- ✅ `openapi.json` updated
- ✅ FastAPI server running (if manual)
- ✅ GPT custom action added (if via GPT)

🎯 **You’re ready to fire `/project/init_project`!**


# 📚 Full Correct Assumptions

| Item | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| A new repo is created per delivery project | ✅ Yes |
| Each repo is initialized at the start using `/project/init_project` | ✅ Yes |
| `/project/init_project` sets up baseline files and structure | ✅ Yes |
| After init, GPT Pods and Human Lead start Phase 1 tasks immediately | ✅ Yes |
| `framework/` folder copied in so each project is semi-standalone but shares standard tooling | ✅ Yes |
| No `/project/NHL Predictor/` needed — all project files live at root level | ✅ Yes |

---

# 🧠 Why This Model is Great

| Benefit | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Clean scaling | 1 repo = 1 project = 1 AI-native lifecycle |
| Easy handoff | Each project repo is self-contained |
| Easy archiving or audits later | Just freeze repo snapshot |
| Easy upgrades | Framework patches can be merged if needed |

✅ It's clean, simple, and scales even as the number of delivery projects grows.

---

# 📋 Therefore Final Answer

✅ **Yes**, you’re supposed to run `/project/init_project` at the start of every delivery project.  
✅ **Yes**, each project lives in its own GitHub repo.  
✅ **Yes**, the outputs (`task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, `outputs/`, etc.) should be at the **repo root** — no `/project/NHL Predictor/` nesting.


# 📋 1. What Went Wrong and How We Fixed It: `/project/init_project`

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ClientResponseError from GPT | API domain changed from `ai-concussion-agent` to `ai-delivery-framework`, but Custom GPT still cached old schema | Updated OpenAPI, refreshed schema fully, deleted/re-added action |
| 500 Internal Server Error | GitHub repo permissions missing or PATH misalignment | Validated PAT permissions, confirmed repo access |
| UnicodeDecodeError on copying files | Tried decoding binary files as UTF-8 text | Added `try-except` block to skip binaries during copy |
| GitHub "path cannot start with slash" 422 error | File paths incorrectly prefixed with `/` | Cleaned path concatenation (no leading slashes) |
| Framework copied into `framework/framework` | Wrong `framework_dest_path` set | Reset `framework_dest_path = ""` |
| GitHub "sha not supplied" error | Tried creating a file that already existed without providing `sha` for update | Clean repo or pre-check existence logic |
| GPT Timeout Error | Copying large framework baseline took longer than GPT tool call timeout | Made copy an async background task (`BackgroundTasks`) so GPT could finish call immediately |
| Files landing in wrong root | Wrong `project_path` logic | Split clean paths: `/framework/` for baseline, `/project/` for init files |

✅ **Result**: Smooth, fast, async Project Initialization working!

---

# 📋 2. Add Enhancements to Batch Backlog (Batch 6)

### 🔹 Failsafe Enhancements
- Add existence check: if framework already copied, skip to avoid `sha` issues.
- Add retry mechanism on GitHub API errors.

### 🔹 Prompt Storage Enhancements
- Save the actual `init_project` starter prompt (like a system trace) in `/outputs/project_init/prompt_used.txt`.

### 🔹 Changelog Enhancements
- Automatically append an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` during `init_project`.

Example entry:
```
## 2025-04-29
- Initialized project NHL Predictor
- Repo: nhl-predictor
- Framework copied from ai-delivery-framework
```

---

# 🛠 Updated Batch Backlog (With Enhancements)

## 🔹 Batch 1: Project Initialization Phase ✅ (Completed!)

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1.1 | Implement `/project/init_project` route and logic |
| 1.2 | Create `scripts/structure_repo.py` to scaffold repo |
| 1.3 | Capture and auto-commit initial prompt and reasoning |
| 1.4 | Initialize `memory.yaml` links for project context |
| 1.5 | Update system prompt for project init process |

---

## 🔹 Batch 2: Discovery Phase (Early Task Execution) 🚀 (Next!)

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2.1 | Implement `/tasks/activate` smart prompt fallback |
| 2.2 | Implement auto-capture of `prompt_used.txt` |
| 2.3 | Implement auto-capture of `reasoning_trace.md` |
| 2.4 | Implement `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` |
| 2.5 | Implement `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` functionality |
| 2.6 | Wire auto-commit into `activate/create/clone` routes |
| 2.7 | Begin wiring changelog updates into these tool handlers |


# 📦 Batch 2 Kickoff: Discovery Phase (Early Task Execution)

---

## 🧠 1. Overview: Changes + Outcomes

| Area | Change | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Task Activation | Implement `/tasks/activate` smart prompt fallback if missing | Human Lead doesn't have to manually draft prompts |
| Prompt Capture | Auto-save `prompt_used.txt` when activating a task | Full traceability of instructions |
| Reasoning Trace | Auto-create `reasoning_trace.md` when task is activated | End-to-end reasoning captured automatically |
| Chain of Thought | Implement `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` | Capture iterative feedback cycles automatically |
| Auto-Commit | Implement `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` | No manual commits after minor task steps |
| Smart Wiring | Wire all of the above into `/tasks/activate` flow | Frictionless task startup |
| Changelog Updates | Begin changelog entries during activation | Full audit trail from Day 1 |

✅ **Batch 2 Outcome**:  
Pods can activate tasks smoothly, with automatic prompt capture, reasoning trace, chain of thought, commits, and changelog entries — no manual ops needed.

---

## 🗂 2. Inputs + Files Needed

| Needed | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| `main.py` (latest, post-batch-1) | ✅ You already have it |
| `openapi.json` (latest) | ✅ You already have it |
| `/tasks/activate` route code | ✅ Exists (we will patch/enhance it) |
| GitHub repo access (`ai-delivery-framework` + `nhl-predictor`) | ✅ Confirmed |
| Existing `scripts/auto_commit.py` helper | 🚧 If missing, I'll patch it during this batch |

---

## 🧩 3. Assumptions

| Assumption | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| GitHub token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) already active for `ai-delivery-framework` and `nhl-predictor` repos | ✅ |
| Directory structure for new project already set up (`/project`, `/outputs`, etc.) | ✅ |
| `memory.yaml` and `task.yaml` initialized per project already | ✅ |

---

## 🛠 4. Error Handling Improvements

| Idea | Plan |
| :--- | :--- |
| Improve exception logging | Add `try/except` blocks with error class + message tracing |
| Retry logic for transient GitHub API issues | Defer to Batch 6 unless simple to implement |
| Custom 422 handling (GitHub `sha` errors) | Defer to Batch 6 (major patch) |

✅ **Result**: Faster debugging when something goes wrong.

---

## 🗣 5. Heaviness of Chat

💬 You are absolutely correct:  
This conversation is huge — easily ~30,000+ tokens.  
At some point, it risks slowdowns, context loss, or errors.

### Recommended Action:

✅ After Batch 2, **start a fresh thread**.  
✅ I’ll prep a full **handoff briefing pack** to load into the new chat:
- Current System Status
- What We've Built
- Current Batch
- Key Files + Repo Setup
- Key Pending Batches

(Just say: "**yes prep briefing pack**" if you want me to start!)

---

# 📣 Ready for Step 4: Print Patches?

If yes, I’ll immediately:

- Draft `/tasks/activate` enhancements (prompt fallback, auto-capture prompt, reasoning)
- Draft `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` route
- Draft `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` route
- Draft auto-changelog entry stubs
- Patch `openapi.json`
- Print everything here cleanly for you to apply


# 🔥 Clarifying the End-to-End Delivery Flow (for Discovery Phase)

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Flow

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Delivery Lead uses `/tasks/activate` to select and activate a task |
| 2 | Custom GPT (DeliveryPod) fetches prompt tied to the task |
| 3 | Custom GPT (DevPod/ResearchPod) processes the prompt and generates output |
| 4 | While doing this, chain of thought (CoT) is captured inline |
| 5 | After completion:<br>→ Save prompt used to `/project/outputs/{task_id}/prompt_used.txt`<br>→ Save reasoning trace to `/project/outputs/{task_id}/reasoning_trace.md`<br>→ Save outputs to `/project/outputs/{task_id}/...` |
| 6 | Auto-commit those files to GitHub (`chatgpt/auto/{task_id}` branch) |
| 7 | (Optionally) Create a promote patch when ready for PR review |
| 8 | Update `task.yaml` (set `status = done`) and optionally update `memory.yaml` if new memory was built |

---

## 🧩 Observations

- **Prompt ➔ Chain of Thought ➔ Reasoning Trace** linkage is **core** and must happen **automatically after every task**.
- **Separation of auto-commit vs. human push/PR** is healthy:
  - Auto-commit (background, fast).
  - `promote_patch` (manual merge, reviewed).
- `task.yaml` updates must also happen smoothly and auto-save to prevent drift between state and Git.

---

# 🔥 My Recommendations

### (a) Should we upgrade existing FastAPI tools to auto-commit?
✅ **Answer: Yes.**

- For key lifecycle events (`activate_task`, `create_new_task`, `clone_task`, `update_metadata`):
  - Immediately auto-commit the updated `task.yaml` or `memory.yaml`.
- If we delay to Batch 3 or 4, we risk misalignment.

**Recommendation**:  
Pull forward partial auto-commit into **Batch 2** scope for `/tasks/activate`.

---

### (b) Should we update `openapi.json` for background_tasks or batch behavior?
❌ **Answer: No change needed yet.**

- `background_tasks` are a **server-side async optimization**.
- They are **already invisible** to `openapi.json`.
- The **response body for `/tasks/activate` remains as-is** — no additional fields needed at this point.


# 🔹 Batch 2: Discovery Phase (Early Task Execution)

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Plan

| Step | Action | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.1 | Implement `/tasks/activate` smart prompt fallback | If prompt file missing, auto-draft it dynamically |
| 2.2 | Implement auto-capture of `prompt_used.txt` | Save the fetched or generated prompt immediately when task starts |
| 2.3 | Implement auto-capture of `reasoning_trace.md` | Begin logging final reasoning once task completed |
| 2.4 | Implement `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` | Allow structured logs of interim Pod thoughts |
| 2.5 | Implement `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` functionality | Enable minor Git commits directly from task work |
| 2.6 | Wire auto-commit into activate/create/clone routes | So all normal task progress is saved automatically |
| 2.7 | Begin wiring changelog updates into these tool handlers | Especially on activation, auto-commit, and reasoning save |
| 2.8 | Patch starter `task.yaml` to point to correct prompt locations | `task_templates/{phase}/{task_id}/prompt_template.md` |
| 2.9 | Create minimal `starter_prompt_generator.py` | If no prompt is found, auto-generate a draft from task description |
| 2.10 | Split task lifecycle into `activate_task` (planning) vs `start_task` (execution) | DeliveryPod activates, Pod picks up separately |
| 2.11 | Implement `/tasks/start` route | When Pod actually begins work; fetch prompt + init context |
| 2.12 | Implement intelligent task-to-task transition system | Auto-handoff: when one task is done, next is activated or proposed |
| 2.13 | Implement early detection if chat/session memory is getting full | Warn or scaffold graceful transition to new chat |
| 2.14 | Wire Pod handoffs to check for pending handoff notes and chain of thought | Continue work seamlessly if a Pod is taking over mid-task |

# 🔥 Proposed Patch Breakdown for Batch 2

To stay iterative and testable, I recommend breaking Batch 2 into **three smaller sub-batches**:

---

## 🛠 Sub-Batch 2A: Core Activation ➔ Start Split

| Scope | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| Core activation (`/tasks/activate`) and start (`/tasks/start`) split | Establish two clean phases: planning (Delivery Lead) vs execution (Pod) |

---

## 🛠 Sub-Batch 2B: Chain of Thought, Reasoning, Auto-Commit

| Scope | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Auto-capture of Chain of Thought<br>- Reasoning Trace generation<br>- Auto-commit working outputs | Capture full working context properly and maintain Git history automatically |

---

## 🛠 Sub-Batch 2C: Intelligent Transitions + Session Scaling

| Scope | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Intelligent task-to-task transitions<br>- Early detection of memory/chat saturation<br>- Pod handoff checks and continuity | Ensure long projects are seamless and minimize manual intervention across Pods or sessions |

---

# ✍️ Detailed Patch Steps for Batch 2

---

## 🔹 Sub-Batch 2A: Task Planning vs Execution (Foundation)

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2.1 | Update `/tasks/activate` to only plan (not start) |
| 2.2 | Implement `/tasks/start` endpoint |
| 2.3 | Implement prompt auto-fetch or draft fallback |
| 2.4 | Auto-save `prompt_used.txt` on start |
| 2.5 | Auto-commit activation and start separately |

✅ **Outcome**: Real-world **plan ➔ execute** lifecycle established.

---

## 🔹 Sub-Batch 2B: Context and Audit Capture (Middle)

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2.6 | Implement `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` |
| 2.7 | Implement `reasoning_trace.md` initial capture |
| 2.8 | Add lightweight `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` endpoint |
| 2.9 | Wire in `CHANGELOG.md` updates during commits |

✅ **Outcome**: Full **traceability**, **auditability**, and **fast commits** enabled.

---

## 🔹 Sub-Batch 2C: Task-to-Task Flow and Scaling (Advanced)

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2.10 | Implement task-to-task transitions after completion |
| 2.11 | Implement Pod handoff logic with `handoff.md` notes |
| 2.12 | Add auto-detect for chat session nearing memory limit |
| 2.13 | Scaffold new chat/session gracefully if needed |

✅ **Outcome**: Long, multi-task, multi-Pod projects **scale elegantly** without disruption.


# (1) Repo Name Management (FastAPI vs Custom GPTs)

✅ **Problem**:  
- `REPO_NAME` variable is missing in `main.py`.  
- Hardcoding it inside FastAPI doesn't scale to multi-projects.

✅ **Best Practice Solution**:
- Pass `repo_name` dynamically on every tool call.
- Custom GPTs (DeliveryPod, DevPod, etc.) must include `"repo_name": "nhl-predictor"` in each POST body.
- FastAPI reads `repo_name` from request and connects to the correct repo dynamically.

✅ **Action for Us**:
- Patch `/tasks/activate`, `/tasks/start/{task_id}`, and any future tools to accept `repo_name` in request body — **not rely on a global variable**.

✅ *(We'll queue this into Batch 2B — small and surgical patch.)*

---

# (3) Activate Multiple Tasks at Once

✅ **Super Useful for**:
- Parallel Pods
- Planning sprint packs
- Pre-staging discovery tasks

✅ **Action for Us**:
- Patch `/tasks/activate` to accept **single or list of `task_ids`**.
- Batch them as "planned" in one update + commit.

✅ *(Add to Batch 2B.)*

---

# (4) Updating `task.yaml` and Prompt Paths

✅ **Immediate Action**:
- Manual fix for `NHL-Predictor` PoC task.yaml prompt paths.
- Example format:
  ```
  prompt: framework/task_templates/Phase1_discovery/1.1_capture_project_goals/prompt_template.md
  ```

✅ **Later Action**:
- Batch 6: Add repo-hardening scripts to automate during `/project/init_project`.

---

# (5) Prompt Auto-Generation on Task Start

✅ **Clarification**:
- Explicitly **queue auto-generate missing prompts** into **Batch 2C**: Smart Start Enhancements.

---

# (6) Return Input Files on Task Start

✅ **Agreed**: DeliveryPod or DevPod needs:
- Prompt (task context)
- Input files

✅ **Action for Us**:
- Patch `/tasks/start/{task_id}` to also return:

```json
{
  "message": "Task started successfully.",
  "prompt_content": "...",
  "inputs": ["input1.md", "input2.json", ...]
}
```

✅ *(Queue into Batch 2B.)*

---

# (7) Write Human Lead Guide (Sprint Guide)

✅ **Agree 100%**.

| Chapter | Topic |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | How to Start a New Project (`init_project`) |
| 2 | How to Plan Tasks |
| 3 | How to Activate/Start Tasks |
| 4 | How to Manage Task Outputs |
| 5 | How to Promote Patches |
| 6 | How to Handoff Pods |
| 7 | How to Recover from Errors |

✅ **Action for Us**:
- Queue into **Batch 6** under "Human Documentation Deliverables".

| 2B.1 | Update `/tasks/activate` to accept `repo_name` | Dynamically route project actions |
| 2B.2 | Update `/tasks/start/{task_id}` to accept `repo_name` | Dynamically fetch the correct project |
| 2B.3 | Patch OpenAPI schema for both | Keep tools aligned with the server changes |
| 2B.4 | Allow `/tasks/activate` to plan multiple tasks | Batch planning for faster multi-task startups |
| 2B.5 | Enhance `/tasks/start` to return prompt + inputs | Provide full task context to Pods immediately |

---

# 📋 Quick Summary of New or Updated Routes

| Route | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/tasks/start` (updated) | Start task, mark as `in_progress`, return prompt + input files |
| `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` (new) | Append messages to a task’s growing Chain of Thought (CoT) file |

---

# 🛠️ Purpose of `auto_commit`

In our AI-native delivery system, work progresses fast (GPT Pods + Human Leads interacting).  
We want small, logical checkpoints — **without** the Human having to:

- Create manual patches,
- Push manually every time,
- Or batch little edits awkwardly.

✅ `auto_commit` allows the system (via GPT Pods) to **lightweight commit important changes** on the fly.

---

# ⚙️ When Do We Call `auto_commit`?

We trigger `auto_commit` automatically inside tools when logical work happens — examples:

| Event | Example Trigger | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Task activated | `/tasks/activate` | Commit updated `task.yaml` (planned status) |
| Task started | `/tasks/start` | Commit updated `task.yaml` (in_progress status) |
| Prompt drafted/missing fallback | `/tasks/activate` | Commit generated `prompt_used.txt` |
| Chain of Thought appended | `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought` | Commit updated `chain_of_thought.yaml` |
| Task completed | *(future batch)* | Commit `done: true` updates |

✅ Always:
- Small commits.
- Context-rich commit messages.
- Only files affected (e.g., commit `task.yaml`, not unrelated files).

---

# 📋 What Files Does `auto_commit` Handle?

Only a **defined, controlled list** of updated files, such as:

- `task.yaml`
- `memory.yaml` (if relevant)
- `outputs/` files (`prompt_used.txt`, `reasoning_trace.md`, `chain_of_thought.yaml`)
- `logs/` or `changelogs/` files

The GPT tool sending the request **specifies**:
- Which files to commit
- A simple, clear commit message

---

# 🔗 Relationship to Promote Patch

| Auto-Commit | Promote Patch |
| :--- | :--- |
| Purpose | Micro, quick saves | Formal bundle of work |
| When | Frequent (after work units) | End of a logical milestone (discovery complete, dev complete, etc.) |
| Human Review? | Not needed immediately | Yes, via PR if desired |
| Git Branch | Direct to main (or light feature branch) | Patch zip or PR branch |

---

# 📈 How This Improves System

| Before | After |
| :--- | :--- |
| GPTs needed Human to push every small update | GPTs self-persist work |
| Risk of loss if chat disconnects | Traceable commits immediately |
| Human burden to patch constantly | Only big batches need human review |
| No easy task-to-task savepoints | Automatic checkpoints at every stage |

---

# 🔥 Final Quick Summary

- `auto_commit` = lightweight "checkpoint saves" during Pod execution.
- Human Lead **doesn't have to think about it**.
- System evolves **live, traceable, and recoverable**.
- **Promote Patch** becomes **rarer, cleaner, strategic**.

# 🛠️ Example Scenario: Discovery Phase Task 1.1

---

## 🎯 Goal

DeliveryPod activates and works on `1.1_capture_project_goals`.

---

## 🛤️ Step-by-Step with Auto-Commit Actions

| Step | Action | Files Touched | Auto-Commit? | Commit Message |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Activate task 1.1 | `task.yaml` | ✅ | Activate task 1.1_capture_project_goals |
| 2 | Draft prompt fallback (no prompt found) | `/project/outputs/1.1_capture_project_goals/prompt_used.txt` | ✅ | Draft prompt for task 1.1_capture_project_goals |
| 3 | Start task (Pod begins work) | `task.yaml` (set `in_progress`) | ✅ | Mark task 1.1_capture_project_goals as in_progress |
| 4 | Chain of Thought entry ("Plan created for capturing project goals") | `/project/outputs/1.1_capture_project_goals/chain_of_thought.yaml` | ✅ | Append CoT for task 1.1_capture_project_goals |
| 5 | Chain of Thought entry ("First draft of goals summary generated") | `/project/outputs/1.1_capture_project_goals/chain_of_thought.yaml` | ✅ | Append CoT for task 1.1_capture_project_goals |
| 6 | Task complete (future batch) | `task.yaml` (mark `done: true`), update `memory.yaml` | ✅ | Mark task 1.1_capture_project_goals as done |
| 7 | (Later) Promote patch milestone | Full outputs zipped | ✅ | Strategic PR (if needed) |

---

## 📸 Git History After Just One Task

```bash
git log --oneline
```
```
abcd123 Activate task 1.1_capture_project_goals
bcde234 Draft prompt for task 1.1_capture_project_goals
cdef345 Mark task 1.1_capture_project_goals as in_progress
defg456 Append CoT for task 1.1_capture_project_goals
efgh567 Append CoT for task 1.1_capture_project_goals
fghi678 Mark task 1.1_capture_project_goals as done
...
(next tasks activate/start similarly)
```

✅ Very small, very understandable commits.  
✅ You can trace the entire story without ever leaving Git.  
✅ Easy rollback or cherry-pick if needed.

---

## 🎯 Visual Lifecycle Mini Diagram

# ✨ Why This Is So Powerful

| Old World | New World |
| :--- | :--- |
| GPT writes to disk but forgets to push | GPTs self-push on important moments |
| Human stress checking every microstep | Human sees clean Git history |
| No trace of reasoning | Reasoning fully captured in repo |
| Risky session timeouts | Safe checkpoints every few minutes |

---

# 🚀 TL;DR

✅ Auto-commits make AI-native SDLC **industrial-grade**.  
✅ Work feels **light to Humans**, while being **ultra-traceable and recoverable underneath**.

---

# 🔥 What's Happening Today in FastAPI Routes?

When we patched `/tasks/activate`, `/tasks/start`, `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought`, etc.,  
those routes now **directly call GitHub** (via PyGitHub) to create/update files:

| Event | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Activating a task | Update `task.yaml` (set `status = activated`) |
| Drafting a prompt | Create `prompt_used.txt` |
| Starting a task | Update `task.yaml` (set `status = in_progress`) |
| Appending to Chain of Thought | Update `chain_of_thought.yaml` |

👉 **Those API routes are already committing to GitHub directly at the time of file update.**  
No extra push or staging step is needed anymore.

✅ It’s immediate.  
✅ It’s traceable.  
✅ It’s atomic per action.

---

# 🛠️ Then... What Is `auto_commit` Tool For?

Originally, `auto_commit` was conceptualized as a separate tool because older flows (months ago)  
were working with **local file edits**, then required a **manual commit** afterwards.

BUT now that we made every route **Git-native**,  
✅ `auto_commit` becomes almost **unnecessary for the normal flow**.

Instead, we use `auto_commit` **only for special cases** like:

| When Needed | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| Saving auxiliary or bulk state changes | If GPT writes reasoning summaries, draft code, doc expansions |
| Emergency checkpointing | If Pods want to commit their "thought state" or drafts mid-task |
| Special batches | When promoting patches, batch-updating many files at once |

---

# 🧠 What This Means

| Situation | Git Write Done Automatically? | Need `auto_commit`? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/tasks/activate`, `/tasks/start`, `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought` | ✅ Yes (direct API writes to GitHub) | ❌ No |
| Pod writes big deliverable (code draft, report) mid-task | ❌ Local creation, not instant commit | ✅ Yes |
| At task "save point" manually by DeliveryPod | ❌ | ✅ Yes |
| Patch promotion of multi-task deliverables | ❌ | ✅ Yes (batch) |

---

# 🚀 TL;DR

- Core routes already **auto-push** = you’re safe.
- `auto_commit` becomes an **auxiliary tool** for **ad-hoc commits** or **bigger flows like promote_patch**.
- ✅ **Batch 2E** will prepare `auto_commit` for the right, minimal real-world uses.
- ✅ Normal task flows **won’t need to manually call `auto_commit`**.

---

# 🔥 Batch 2F: Changelog Auto-Update

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Actions

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2F.1 | Implement `/tasks/update_changelog/{task_id}` route |
| 2F.2 | Auto-generate clean `CHANGELOG.md` entry |
| 2F.3 | Auto-commit `CHANGELOG.md` updates |
| 2F.4 | Wire changelog update inside activate, start, complete flows (later batches) |

---

## 🎯 Quick Plan for Batch 2F

**Goal**:  
After any important task transition (like activate, start, complete), we want a clean entry automatically logged into `CHANGELOG.md` inside `/project/outputs/`.

---

## ✅ Patch Contents

- Add `/tasks/update_changelog/{task_id}` route.
- Given `task_id` + `changelog_message` → append an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Commit the updated `CHANGELOG.md` using the new `/tasks/auto_commit`.
- Update OpenAPI JSON schema with the new route/tool.

---

## ⚡ Inputs Needed (for Patch 2F)

- **Nothing special needed!**
- We will:
  - Follow the same repo structure.
  - Use the same GitHub token from last batch.
- `CHANGELOG.md` will be located at:
  ```
  /project/outputs/CHANGELOG.md
  ```

---

# 📋 Batch 2F: Add Reasoning Trace Generation

---

## 🛠 Scope of Batch 2F

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2F.1 | New route: `/tasks/complete/{task_id}` to trigger task completion |
| 2F.2 | Upon complete:<br>→ Read `/outputs/{task_id}/chain_of_thought.yaml`<br>→ Auto-format and generate `reasoning_trace.md` based on your template<br>→ Save `reasoning_trace.md` to `/outputs/{task_id}/reasoning_trace.md`<br>→ Auto-commit `reasoning_trace.md` via `/tasks/auto_commit` |
| 2F.3 | Minor: Update `task.yaml` to mark the task `status = completed` |

---

## 📝 Notes

- We will **reformat** chain of thought ideas into the `## Thoughts` section of the `reasoning_trace.md`.
- We will **stub** other sections if not provided (ensuring the template is always complete).
- We can **later enrich** the reasoning trace if the Pod or Human Lead provides:
  - Scoring
  - Extra analysis
- **Auto-track** full reasoning **end-to-end** for every completed task.

---

## ✅ Benefits

- Very lightweight to add now.
- Makes Batch 2 full and **production-ready** for the NHL PoC.
- Ensures clean, auditable delivery flows.

---

# ✅ Batch 3 Overview: What We're Changing

---

## 🛠 Extending from Discovery ➝ Development

We are now enabling **in-progress work capture** and **midstream visibility**, including:

- **Mid-task commits** (not just at completion)
- **Design + interim deliverables** captured and versioned
- **Fallback logic** for missing data (e.g., missing prompts)
- **Live updates** to:
  - `chain_of_thought.yaml`
  - `reasoning_trace.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## 🎯 Outcomes (The "Why")

| Goal | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Traceability of partial outputs | Track work in real-time during development |
| Reduced friction | Tasks continue even if metadata is incomplete |
| Audit-readiness | Changelog and reasoning traces evolve live |
| Higher reusability | Cloned tasks include full historical capture |

---

## 📥 Inputs I’ll Need From You

- ✅ Confirm repo for patching: **`ai-delivery-framework`**
- ✅ Confirm PoC test repo: **`nhl-predictor`**
- 📄 Latest versions of:
  - `task.yaml`
  - `memory.yaml`
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (if exists)
  - `framework/tools/github_ops.py` (or wherever `auto_commit()` is defined)
  - All existing routes in `/tasks/` (I'll pull full files)

- 🤖 **Prompt scaffolding format** (for fallback generation)

---

## 📌 Assumptions to Validate

- `auto_commit()` is **idempotent and safe** to call multiple times
- Task metadata is **uniquely identified** and JSON-friendly
- Designs and interim outputs will follow **naming conventions** like `design_*.md`
- Changelog entries can be **temporary or timestamped**
- No **circular dependency** risk when writing reasoning traces or changelogs mid-task

---

## ❓ Open Questions

| Question | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Should `append_reasoning_trace` be its own route or embedded in `/complete` or `/auto_commit`? | Consider based on whether trace needs to be built incrementally |
| What counts as a “design” or “interim deliverable”? | Is it anything in `/docs/`, or should we implement a tagging mechanism? |
| Should fallback prompt generation use a **default template**, or look for a local scaffold file? | Could default to inline or pull from `task_templates/fallback_prompt_template.md` |
| Should changelog entries be **structured JSON** or plain markdown snippets? | Structured is more parseable, markdown is more human-readable |

---

# ✅ Scope of Batch 3: Development Phase Support

We’ll implement tooling to support **traceable, safe, and audit-ready** delivery work mid-task.

---

## 🔹 Feature Set

| Step | Feature | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3.1 | Auto-commit on `update_metadata` | Captures metadata changes (e.g., outputs, prompt path) |
| 3.2 | Auto-commit on `clone` | Saves new task definition immediately |
| 3.3 | Save chain of thought mid-task | Incrementally builds up task history |
| 3.4 | Add reasoning trace at completion | Captures final rationale |
| 3.5 | Auto-update `changelog.md` | Ensures traceability per task |
| 3.6 | Fallback prompt generation | Handles missing prompt cases using `task.yaml` context |
| 3.7 | Auto-commit generated outputs | Pushes files listed in `task.yaml > outputs` |
| 3.8 | Ensure full delivery traceability | Final audit trail from prompt → outputs → git |

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan

We’ll ship Batch 3 in **two sub-batches** for testing clarity.

### 📦 Sub-Batch 3A: Mid-task Support & Traceability

- Hook into `/tasks/update_metadata` → triggers auto-commit of `task.yaml`
- Hook into `/tasks/clone` → commits new `task.yaml` clone immediately
- Hook into `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` → appends to YAML and commits

**Files Modified**:
- `main.py`
- Supporting scripts (e.g., `auto_commit` wrapper, YAML ops)

---

### 📦 Sub-Batch 3B: Completion & Changelog Capture

- Hook into `/tasks/complete`:
  - Writes `reasoning_trace.md`
  - Auto-commits it
- Hook into `/tasks/auto_commit`:
  - Commits task-defined outputs
  - Calls `update_changelog`
- Add fallback prompt generator:
  - Auto-synthesizes from description, inputs, project context
- Scaffold `CHANGELOG.md` (structured YAML format):
```yaml
- task_id: 1.1_capture_project_goals
  timestamp: 2025-04-26T23:06:52Z
  change: "Completed task and generated project goals"
```

---

## 📥 Required Inputs

✅ All provided:
- `task.yaml`
- `memory.yaml`
- `main.py`
- `openapi.json`

---

## 📌 Final Assumptions & Confirmations

- ✅ Interim deliverables don’t need versioning — only final outputs matter
- ✅ `reasoning_trace.md` is auto-added at task complete
- ✅ `changelog.md` will be structured YAML
- ✅ Fallback prompt is auto-synthesized from task metadata

---

## ✅ Next Step: Testing Scope

Once patch lands, resume test from:
→ `1.1_capture_project_goals` in `nhl-predictor`

**Test that**:
- `task.yaml` updates are auto-committed
- `chain_of_thought.yaml` grows correctly
- `reasoning_trace.md` is generated + committed
- `project_goals.md` is pushed to GitHub
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry is created

---

# ✅ Updated Proposal: Structured `reasoning_trace.yaml`

---

## 📂 File Path

```
/project/outputs/{task_id}/reasoning_trace.yaml
```

---

## 📄 YAML Format (Based on Template)

```yaml
task_id: 1.1_capture_project_goals

thoughts:
  - thought: "Used existing project goals file as context to summarize vision"
    tags: ["recall_used"]
  - thought: "Reframed goals to align with measurable outcomes"
    tags: ["novel_insight"]

alternatives:
  - "Could have used competitive benchmarks"
  - "Could have added goals from external stakeholders"

improvement_opportunities:
  - "Involve human review earlier in summarization"

scoring:
  thought_quality: 4
  recall_used: true
  novel_insight: true

summary: "Prompt understanding was strong; future prompts could explore goals diversity."
```

---

## 🧩 Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Traceability** | Each task has one consistent format |
| **Analytics-ready** | YAML is structured for dashboards, scorecards, ML |
| **Extensible** | Add fields like `confidence_scores`, `contributors`, `cross_links`, etc. later |

---

## 🛠️ Action Plan – Batch 3B

- ✅ Implement `reasoning_trace.yaml` generator at `/tasks/complete`
- ✅ Ensure no `.md` file is created — YAML only
- ✅ Match all fields to this format
- ✅ Use fallback defaults if a section is missing

---

Would you like me to scaffold a **YAML schema validator** or example `reasoning_trace.yaml` generator script for test coverage? 🧪📂

---

# ✅ Scope: Batch 3B – Output & Audit Layer

This batch ensures we can capture final artifacts, trace the rationale, and log changelog entries for every meaningful output push.

---

## 🔹 What We'll Implement

| Step | Feature | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3.4 | Auto-generate `reasoning_trace.yaml` | Structured trace of conclusions, rationale, and scores |
| 3.5 | Write to `CHANGELOG.md` per task | Audit trail of work done and decisions |
| 3.6 | Fallback prompt generation | Synthesizes prompt using `task.yaml`, project context, and history |
| 3.7 | Auto-push outputs listed in `task.yaml` | Delivers the actual file artifacts to Git |
| — | *(Optional)* Refactor `/complete` | Modularize into trace, changelog, and push helpers |

---

## 🛠️ Target Routes to Modify

### `/tasks/complete`
- 🔹 Generate and save `reasoning_trace.yaml`
- 🔹 Auto-commit the trace
- 🔹 Write new entry to `/CHANGELOG.md`
- 🔹 Commit all outputs listed in `task.yaml`

### `/tasks/auto_commit`
- 🔹 Extend to:
  - Scan `task.yaml`
  - Push all listed `outputs`

### *(Optional)* Fallback Prompt Generator
- Utility reads:
  - `task.yaml > description`, `inputs`, `outputs`
  - Project docs (`/docs/*.md`)
  - Project name from `memory.yaml`

---

## 🧩 Design Notes

### 🧠 Reasoning Trace Format
As defined earlier – structured YAML, including:
```yaml
thoughts:
  - thought: "..."
    tags: ["..."]
summary: "..."
scoring:
  thought_quality: 4
```

### 📓 Changelog Format
Append under `/CHANGELOG.md`:
```yaml
- task_id: 1.1_capture_project_goals
  timestamp: 2025-04-26T23:06:52Z
  change: "Generated project_goals.md based on discussion"
```

### 🔍 Output Handling
- Outputs are inferred from `task.yaml > outputs`
- Files not found = skipped (not error)
- Push only files that exist

---

## 📥 Inputs Needed

- ✅ None new required
- ✅ Outputs read from `task.yaml`

---

## ✅ Assumptions

| Assumption | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| Auto-commit of `reasoning_trace.yaml` is enabled | ✅ |
| CHANGELOG entry added per-task | ✅ |
| Outputs tracked in `task.yaml > outputs` | ✅ |
| Outputs skipped if not created | ✅ No error thrown |

---

## 🔍 Testing Plan

Resume task: `1.1_capture_project_goals` in `nhl-predictor`  
Then call: `POST /tasks/complete`

**Verify**:
- `reasoning_trace.yaml` created with thoughts, scores, summary
- `project_goals.md` committed to GitHub (if present)
- `CHANGELOG.md` has a new structured YAML entry

---

# ✅ changelog.yaml System Design – Batch 3B

---

## 🧩 Rationale: Why Use Structured YAML

| Benefit | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Machine-readable** | Enables querying, sorting, slicing by tool or time |
| **System-consistent** | Matches other structured files (`task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, etc.) |
| **Metrics-ready** | Powers future dashboards, KPIs, and PR summaries |
| **Multi-file & multi-purpose** | Supports task-based and system-wide logs (e.g., template edits) |

---

## 🗂️ File Location & Format

**Filename**:  
```
/changelog.yaml
```

**Structure**:
```yaml
- timestamp: 2025-04-26T23:06:52Z
  files:
    - path: docs/project_goals.md
      change: "Created project goals from 1.1 task"
    - path: task.yaml
      change: "Marked task 1.1 as complete"
```

---

## 🔧 Proposed Commit Helper: `commit_and_log()`

This function wraps both GitHub file writes **and changelog logging**.

```python
def commit_and_log(repo, file_path, content, commit_message):
    # Commit file to GitHub
    if file_exists(repo, file_path):
        repo.update_file(file_path, commit_message, content)
    else:
        repo.create_file(file_path, commit_message, content)

    # Log to changelog.yaml
    log_entry = {
        "timestamp": now_utc_iso(),
        "files": [{"path": file_path, "change": commit_message}]
    }
    append_to_changelog_yaml(repo, log_entry)
```

- Replaces raw `create_file`/`update_file` in all critical tools
- Handles multi-file commit scenarios with chaining or batching

---

## 🎯 Implementation Points

| Element | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| ✅ changelog file type | `changelog.yaml` |
| ✅ file location | Root of repo (`/changelog.yaml`) |
| ✅ log granularity | Timestamp-based key, multiple files per entry |
| ✅ routes using it | `/tasks/complete`, `/tasks/auto_commit`, `/tasks/update_metadata`, etc. |
| ✅ backward compatibility | Old `.md` files deprecated (not written anymore) |

---

## 🔍 Testing Criteria

- After `complete`, changelog.yaml includes trace of:
  - task.yaml update
  - reasoning_trace.yaml write
  - any outputs committed
- Timestamps are ISO 8601
- All messages are human-readable
- File paths are relative and accurate

---

# 🔥 Updated Batch 3C Scope – Commit Layer Refactor

---

## ✅ Refactor Functions to Use `commit_and_log()`

| Function | Line | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `update_task_metadata` | 1114 | ✅ Already planned |
| `clone_task` | 532 | ✅ Already planned |
| `append_chain_of_thought` | 563/565 | ✅ Already planned |
| `activate_task` | 456 | 🆕 **Add to plan** |
| `start_task` | 480 | 🆕 **Add to plan** |

---

## ✅ Bonus Optimization

- **Introduce** a `get_repo(repo_name)` helper:
  - Simplifies repo access everywhere.
  - Centralizes repo fetch logic for consistency.

---

## 🧹 Deprecation Plan: Legacy Tools

| Tool | Status | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `auto_commit` | LEGACY | Comment out with `# LEGACY: Replaced by commit_and_log()` |
| `promote_patch` | LEGACY | Comment out with `# LEGACY: Replaced by commit_and_log()` |
| `create_or_update_file` (inside promote_patch) | LEGACY | Comment out with `# LEGACY: Replaced by commit_and_log()` |

⚡ **Notes**:
- **Don't delete yet** — just mark and comment.
- Full removal will occur in **Batch 6: System Hardening** after E2E testing is completed.

---

## 📋 Final Confirmed Scope of Batch 3C

| Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Refactor `update_task_metadata` | ✅ Use `commit_and_log` |
| Refactor `clone_task` | ✅ Use `commit_and_log` |
| Refactor `append_chain_of_thought` | ✅ Use `commit_and_log` |
| Refactor `activate_task` | 🆕 Use `commit_and_log` |
| Refactor `start_task` | 🆕 Use `commit_and_log` |
| Introduce `get_repo()` helper | 🆕 |
| Deprecate `auto_commit` | 🆕 LEGACY tag |
| Deprecate `promote_patch` | 🆕 LEGACY tag |
| Deprecate `create_or_update_file` | 🆕 LEGACY tag |

---

# ✨ End Result After Batch 3C

- Unified Git write logic via `commit_and_log`
- Clear, centralized repo access via `get_repo`
- Legacy patchwork safely deprecated but recoverable
- Traceable, consistent Git history across all Pod actions

---

# 🔥 SHA Handling in `commit_and_log`

---

## 📋 Concern Breakdown

| Concern | Situation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Should we pass SHA into `commit_and_log`? | Ideally yes, for strict concurrency protection. |
| Is the risk real? | Only if two GPTs or humans push the *same file* within milliseconds (extremely rare in current scale). |
| Should we optimize now? | ❗ **No** — Over-optimizing adds unnecessary complexity at this stage. |
| Future solution? | Plan to add an optional `sha_check` parameter during **Batch 6: System Hardening** if needed. |

---

## ✅ Final Decision

- No SHA passing for now.
- Keep `commit_and_log()` **frictionless and simple**.
- Trust sequential task flows for now (pods rarely push same files simultaneously).
- Future-proof by planning SHA handling as an optional upgrade later.

---

## 📅 Future Enhancement (Batch 6 Target)

Add `sha_check` to `commit_and_log`:

```python
def commit_and_log(repo, file_path, content, commit_message, sha_check=None):
    # If sha_check provided, verify SHA before updating
    # Otherwise proceed normally
```

---

# ✨ Net Benefit

- Simpler codebase ✅
- Faster patch cycle ✅
- Lower cognitive load for devs ✅
- No real concurrency risk yet ✅

---

# ✅ Batch 3 Backlog Status (as of now)

| Step | Action | Status | Notes |

### 📥 Required Inputs From You

To begin patching:
- ✅ Latest version of `main.py` (we can use existing canvas)  
- ✅ Latest `openapi.json` (already uploaded unless you want to re-send)  
- No new files needed unless any routes have changed outside of current scope.

### 📌 Assumptions to Confirm

| Assumption                                                           | Confirmation |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `memory.yaml` is committed under `/project/`                         | ✅ Confirmed  |
| Task metadata may include scoring or tags                            | ✅ Okay to extend `reasoning_trace.yaml` |
| You want to capture GPT + Human inputs in test reasoning trace       | ✅ Yes        |
| Natural language task search and tool routing interpreted by GPT Pod | ✅ Framework enhancement only — not user-facing yet |

🧠 **Response to Your Question**  
**How will we populate `description`, `tags`, `pod_owner` in `/memory/index`?**

We'll defer to the calling Pod (usually a system tool) to supply richer metadata. Potential improvements:

- Auto-fill `description` from file contents or `task.yaml`
- Allow override via `/memory/add`
- Link with `task.yaml` inputs/outputs to derive `pod_owner`

📌 We'll add a future batch item for **memory metadata enrichment and task-linking**.
