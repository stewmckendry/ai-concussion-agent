## ‚úÖ (1) Playback: What You‚Äôre Asking For

You're at a pivotal moment with your AI-native delivery framework, aiming to:

- Launch a **"sandbox GPT pod"** for public experimentation.  
- Establish a **secure, reliable infrastructure** that supports others safely building apps.  
- **Avoid rework or overly restrictive controls**, while protecting work from accidental or malicious loss.  
- Introduce **branching/versioning discipline**, especially before others start writing to your repos.

**Your stack includes:**

- A FastAPI server on Railway using a GitHub PAT.  
- Two repos:  
  - `ai-delivery-framework` (framework and tools)  
  - `nhl-predictor` (testbed for outputs)  
- All tools write using `commit_and_log()` and assume access to main branches directly.

---

## üß† (2) Strategy Recommendation

A balanced and phased plan to manage **security, collaboration, and resilience** without major overhaul.

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Quick Wins to Reduce Risk

- Create a `sandbox` branch in `nhl-predictor` for all sandbox GPT pods.  
- Modify `commit_and_log()` to:  
  - Support writing to a named branch (default: `main`)  
  - Include metadata about authoring pod/user  
- Introduce GitHub branch protection on `main`:  
  - Disable force pushes  
  - Require PRs for writes (allow auto-merge for internal tools)  
  - Log all write access with a commit signature (metadata or GPG)

### üõ°Ô∏è Phase 2: Securing Multi-user Sandbox Mode

- Provision a "sandbox GPT pod" with scoped access:  
  - Reads from `main`, writes to `sandbox`  
  - Cannot update changelog or memory in production branches  
- Consider **JWT auth** over PAT for per-user/session access  
- Isolate `memory.yaml` / `changelog.yaml` per pod or branch

### üö® Phase 3: Protection Against Loss or Mistakes

- Enable GitHub branch-level backups or:  
  - Auto-clone `main` to `backup/{timestamp}` daily  
  - Periodically archive `changelog`/`memory` files  
- Use the existing `rollback_commit` endpoint to recover commits

### ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Enhancements

- Introduce a `PRBot` tool that:  
  - Suggests diffs for review  
  - Auto-approves sandbox changes under 5 LOC  

---

## üîß (3) Implementation Plan + Backlog

### üîπ Infrastructure & Branching

- Create sandbox branches in both repos  
- Update `commit_and_log()` to support target branch (default: `main`)  
- Create env variable for `DEFAULT_WRITE_BRANCH`

### üîπ Access Control

- Rotate and restrict GitHub PAT used in server  
- Implement GitHub repo branch protections via API/settings  
- Use Railway secrets to manage sandbox vs production tokens

### üîπ Sandbox Pod Prep

- Launch `sandbox-gpt-pod` with write access only to `nhl-predictor@sandbox`  
- Disable memory/changelog updates for sandbox pods  
- Track usage/commits for audit logging

### üîπ Resilience

- Add daily backup cronjob: clone `main` to `backup/YYYY-MM-DD`  
- Create `/system/backup` endpoint to snapshot key files (memory, changelog)  
- Document rollback via `/git/rollback_commit`

---

## ‚ùì (4) Inputs Needed from You

To make this live, I need:

- ‚úÖ **Confirmation:** Is `sandbox` branch your preferred name?  
- üîê **Restrictions:** Should sandbox users be limited to a subset of tools?  
- üìú **Branches:** Should I update `commit_and_log()` for multi-branch now?  
- üë• **Pods:** Are you planning multiple sandbox pods or one shared?  
- üßæ **Metadata:** Any extra metadata you want logged per commit (e.g. user ID)?

---

## ‚úÖ STRATEGY (Refined with Your Inputs)

### üí° Core Principles

- **Safety First**: Avoid data loss with backups and rollback tools.  
- **User Isolation**: Each sandbox user gets their own branch copy.  
- **Frictionless Experience**: No need for every user to learn Git.  
- **Minimal Refactor**: We upgrade existing tools, not redesign them.  
- **Gradual Rollout**: Begin with a shared GPT pod in a protected sandbox.

### üîë KEY CONCEPTS FOR YOU

| Concept             | Explanation                                 | Our Plan                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **sandbox branch**  | An isolated playground in your test repo    | Users write here, not `main`                      |
| **Per-user branch** | User X gets `sandbox-alice`, User Y gets `sandbox-bob` | Avoids conflict and enables traceability      |
| **Write isolation** | Tools write to branches with guardrails     | Prevents users from damaging shared code           |
| **commit_and_log() upgrade** | Adds a branch parameter to control target branch | Default is `main`, sandbox uses `sandbox-*` |
| **PAT safety**      | GitHub tokens currently allow full write access | Scope usage, then rotate to per-user/app tokens |
| **GitHub protections** | GitHub lets you protect branches (e.g. require PRs) | Apply to `main`, not `sandbox-*`             |
| **GPT pod sandboxing** | All users share a single GPT pod          | Actions isolated by assigned branch                |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### PHASE 1: Safe Sandbox Launch

#### üß© Core Changes
- Create `sandbox` branch in `nhl-predictor`
- Update `commit_and_log()`:
  - Add `branch` parameter (default = `main`)
  - Include commit metadata: `committed_by`, `task_id`
- Update API endpoint + OpenAPI spec to accept `branch` (non-breaking)
- Update GPT custom actions: add optional `branch` param, default to `sandbox` for sandbox pods

#### üîí Safety Layers
- Enable branch protections:
  - On `main` for both repos (no direct pushes, optional PR requirement)
  - No protections on `sandbox-*` branches (for now)
- Add `/git/rollback_commit` fallback to UI/tooling

---

### PHASE 2: Per-User Branching + GPT Integration

#### üë§ User Isolation
- Add `user_id` (e.g. `sandbox-alice`) into GPT session context
- Fork `sandbox` branch as `sandbox-{user}` on first use
- Auto-switch tool calls to write to user‚Äôs branch

#### üö• Traceability
- Log per-commit metadata:
  - `committed_by` (e.g. GPT user ID)
  - `task_id` (if known)
  - Optional: `timestamp`, `GPT version`

#### üß† Tool Access Scope
- Assess tool access needs:
  - Minimum: `commit_and_log`, `fetchFiles`, `initProject`, `listActions`
  - Possibly omit: `rollback`, `handoff`, `completeTask` unless needed

---

### PHASE 3: Security & Scale Readiness

#### üîÑ Backups & Recovery
- Nightly snapshot of `main` to `backup/YYYY-MM-DD`
- Export `memory.yaml` and `changelog.yaml` as JSON weekly

#### üõ°Ô∏è Token & Auth Hardening
- Replace PAT with a GitHub App (fine-grained permissions)
- Limit write scope to `sandbox-*` branches
- Expire tokens for users after inactivity

#### üîç Monitoring
- Audit logs on branch usage, file writes, and errors
- Alert on invalid `memory.yaml` or large write diffs

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è NEXT STEPS

I can now:
- Refactor `commit_and_log()` to support multi-branch  
- Suggest `OpenAPI` + `main.py` edits  
- Draft a spec for user-branch auto-provisioning  

---

## How we'll work together
### üõ†Ô∏è Collaboration Process
The way we will work together is:
1. I queue up next steps in the backlog, present the plan, and ask the inputs you need from me
2. I confirm the plan and provide inputs
3. You update plan if needed, and generate the "patch" (which could be code, instructions, etc.)
4. I "execute" the patch, and confirm if issues or done
5. You update the backlog, and we go back to step 1

---

## (1a) ‚ú® ‚ÄúTry it yourself!‚Äù Setup Flow

Once everything is live, the user flow might be:

> *"Try it yourself! Head to [chat.openai.com/gpts](https://chat.openai.com/gpts) and search for **'AI Native Sandbox GPT'** or use this link [insert link]. Once inside, just start chatting ‚Äî the system will create a safe working branch for you and help you build an AI-native app from scratch."*

No installation or Git knowledge required ‚Äî the GPT guides each step.

---

## (1b) ü§ù What Users Need from You

**Nothing manual per user.** The GPT pod will:

- Auto-generate a `sandbox-{unique_id}` branch if it doesn‚Äôt exist  
- Route all actions to their isolated branch  

**You‚Äôll need to:**

- Publish the GPT to the public via OpenAI  
- Point it to your live FastAPI server + token with branch support  

---

## (1c) üå± How Will Users Know What Branch to Use?

They won‚Äôt need to ‚Äî the GPT pod handles it behind the scenes.

**For transparency**, include in responses:
> *‚ÄúSaving your work to branch: sandbox-celestial-river‚Äù*

---

## (2) üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Tracking Without Personal Info

We can generate **anonymous, non-identifiable** `user_id`s like:

- `sandbox-emerald-hawk`  
- `sandbox-crimson-wave`

**Generation methods:**

- Hashed session start time  
- OpenAI conversation ID (if available)  
- Random adjective‚Äìnoun combinations  

**Logged metadata:**

- `branch`: sandbox-{user}  
- `committed_by`: same  
- `task_id`: optional  
- **No IPs, names, or emails**

---

## (3) Is This for Just Experiment or Full-Use?

**Right now:** Experiment phase ‚Äî isolated sandbox, no shared state.

**For full adoption**, users/orgs will need:

- Their own repo or fork of the framework  
- GPT pod configuration for their projects  
- Optional self-hosted backends  

**Additional steps:**

- Admin portal for usage/branch monitoring  
- Fine-grained permission controls (read/write scope)  
- OAuth-based GitHub integration  

What we‚Äôre building now lays a **reusable foundation for both**.

## üß† RESPONSES TO YOUR QUESTIONS

### ‚úÖ Should All Tools Accept `branch`?

**Yes** ‚Äî any tool that writes to Git via `commit_and_log()` should accept an optional `branch` parameter, just like `repo_name`.

**Why?**
- Keeps GPT routing logic consistent
- Future-proofs workflows (diffing, patching, rollback)

‚úÖ **Backlog item added:** Update all tool routes to accept `branch`.

---

### ü§î How Does the GPT Pod Know What Branch to Use?

#### ‚ùå Option 1: GPT Invents Branch Name

- **Risk:** Name collisions, human error
- GPT must invent a valid, unique name and remember it
- **Not recommended**

#### ‚úÖ Option 2: System Assigns a Unique Sandbox Branch

**Best approach:**
1. GPT starts session by calling a `/sandbox/init_branch` (or `/get_started`) route
2. Server:
   - Checks for a prior branch via session token or ID
   - If not found, generates new branch (e.g. `sandbox-emerald-wolf`)
   - Forks from `sandbox` branch
   - Returns: branch name + repo name + welcome message
3. GPT stores response and uses it in all tool calls:
   ```json
   {
     "repo_name": "nhl-predictor",
     "branch": "sandbox-emerald-wolf"
   }
    ```

## ‚úÖ DESIGN: `/sandbox/init_branch`

### Goal

Allow a GPT pod to initialize or resume a **safe, unique sandbox branch per user** ‚Äî without exposing personal information or risking collisions.

---

### üîÑ Request Body
```json
{
  "repo_owner": "YOUR_ORG",
  "repo_name": "nhl-predictor",
  "reuse_token": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWVnaXQ=", // Optional ‚Äî if set, reuse prior branch
  "force_new": false // Optional ‚Äî override reuse behavior
}
```
### üîÑ Response Body
```json
{
"branch": "sandbox-emerald-wave",
"reuse_token": "aHR0cDovL3NvbWVnaXQ=", // base64 or HMAC-safe
"repo_name": "nhl-predictor",
"created": true,
"message": "Welcome! Your sandbox is ready in branch sandbox-emerald-wave."
}
```


---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Logic

- If `reuse_token` is **present and valid**:
  - Decode to get branch name
  - Return it if it still exists  
  - Or recreate from base branch (`sandbox`) if `force_new = false`

- If **no token** or `force_new = true`:
  - Generate a random, collision-checked branch name (e.g. `sandbox-cosmic-eagle`)
  - Create branch from `sandbox`
  - Generate a secure `reuse_token` tied to the branch (e.g. HMAC + salt or encrypted string)

---

### üîê Security

- **Reuse token** should not expose branch name in plain text  
- Options:
  - Base64-encoded string with a prefix salt (**fast**)  
  - HMAC(key + branch_name + nonce) (**safer**)  
- System **never trusts or uses branch names** directly from the token

---

## üß† WHAT THE USER NEEDS TO REMEMBER

### üéØ Minimal Info: Just the `reuse_token`

- This token:
  - Encodes their assigned branch (e.g. `sandbox-emerald-wave`)
  - Can be reused across sessions or GPT chats
  - Cannot be easily reverse-engineered to guess other tokens

- üîê The **branch name is not required** to resume work ‚Äî but can be shown for transparency.

---

## üó£Ô∏è WHO TELLS THE USER?

After calling `/sandbox/init_branch`, the **GPT pod** will reply with something like:

> ‚úÖ *Your personal sandbox is ready on branch `sandbox-emerald-wave`.*  
> *To return to this workspace in the future, save this token:*  
> `aHR0cDovL3NvbWVnaXQ=`  
> *(keep this safe ‚Äî it links back to your work!)*

For added usability (especially outside ChatGPT), consider:

- A **copy-to-clipboard** UI button  
- A **file download** link with the token embedded

## ‚úÖ Task 2.2: Auto-create Branch from `sandbox` If Not Exists

This behavior is **already implemented** as part of the `/sandbox/init_branch` route. Task 2.2 is now considered complete.

---

### üîÅ Auto-Branch Creation Logic Recap

Within the `/sandbox/init_branch` logic:

- If `reuse_token` is **missing or invalid**  
- And no valid `sandbox-{...}` branch exists  
- Then:
  - A **random branch name** is generated (e.g. `sandbox-cosmic-fox`)
  - A **new branch is created** from the base `sandbox` branch
  - This new branch is returned to the GPT pod

---

### ‚úÖ Implications

- **No separate setup or patch** is needed for this logic  
- GPT pods can **safely request** a new or reused workspace on every session

| 2.2  | Auto-create branch from `sandbox` if not exists | ProductPod  | ‚úÖ     | Handled in `/sandbox/init_branch`             |

---

## üéØ Goal

Ensure GPT pods **communicate clearly** which branch the user is working in, so users:

- Understand their sandbox is isolated  
- Can note the branch for future reference  
- Feel confident about their working environment

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation Plan

This task doesn‚Äôt require a backend patch ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **standardizing GPT behavior**.

We already return the `branch` in the `/sandbox/init_branch` response. The goal is to ensure:

- GPT **stores** the `branch` and `reuse_token` in memory  
- GPT **echoes** the `branch` in key responses

---

## üí¨ Recommendation for GPT Messaging

When GPT receives a response from `/sandbox/init_branch`:

1. **Store**:
   - `branch`
   - `reuse_token`

2. **Reply** to the user with something like:

> ‚úÖ *You're now working in branch `sandbox-crimson-fox` of the `nhl-predictor` repo.*  
> *To resume this later, keep your token:*  
> `c2FuZGJveC1jcmltc29uLWZveA==`

---

## üß† Integration Tip

In your GPT instructions or action handlers, encourage the GPT pod to:

- **Remind the user** of their active branch and `repo_name` during key events:
  - First commit
  - Completing a task
  - Displaying a diff or rollback option

- Say something like:

> *‚ÄúI've saved that file to branch `sandbox-emerald-owl`. Let me know if you'd like to push to main or share your work.‚Äù*

---

## üß† (2) System Prompt Addition for GPT Pod

### üîß Update your GPT system prompt with:

> *You will receive a `repo_name`, `branch`, and `reuse_token` from the `/sandbox/init_branch` tool. Store them all in memory and use them in every tool call. Always tell the user what repo and branch you're working in.*

### üí¨ Example Reply:

> *You're now working in the `nhl-predictor` repo on branch `sandbox-emerald-fox`. Save this token to resume later: `c2FuZGJveC1lbWVyYWxkLWZveA==`*

This ensures clear user orientation and reliable reuse of context across sessions.

## üîí AUTH: Are Users Authenticated by Branch Name?

### Current Behavior

Right now, **having the `branch` + `repo_name`** is sufficient to write to that branch.

‚úÖ **That‚Äôs OK for Sandbox Use:**

- Each branch is **randomized and non-discoverable**
- `reuse_token` provides convenience, **not additional security**
- This is effectively a **private link** model ‚Äî secure by obscurity

---

### For Production

We‚Äôll eventually migrate to stronger models:

- GitHub App installation with per-user access  
- **Token-bound branch validation**  
- Server-side **mapping of tokens ‚Üí allowed branches**

‚úÖ **Added to long-term security plan** (see backlog Task 4.2)
