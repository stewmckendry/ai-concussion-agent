ü§î **Why These Tools Matter**  
In traditional apps, you're limited to fixed screens and buttons. With AI tools like this one, you talk to a smart assistant ‚Äî but that assistant still needs a reliable set of tools to do useful work.  
These tools give the AI ‚Äúhands and memory.‚Äù Without them:
- You‚Äôd have to explain everything every time (no memory).
- The AI wouldn‚Äôt know how to fetch files or save progress.
- You couldn‚Äôt build or ship real apps or documents with help from the AI.

Now, instead of just chatting, your GPT-powered teammates can:
- Browse your files  
- Create and complete tasks  
- Pass off work to others  
- Track issues and metrics  
- Leave thoughtful comments or lessons learned  

It‚Äôs like giving your GPT a project dashboard, filing cabinet, and notepad ‚Äî so you don‚Äôt have to explain or redo everything each time.

---

üõ†Ô∏è **What Can You Do?**

| **Goal** | **Use this Tool** |
|----------|-------------------|
| Start working on a task | `/tasks/lifecycle` ‚Üí `start` |
| Save your output and progress | `/tasks/commit_and_log_output` |
| Review what you thought or learned | `/tasks/chain_of_thought` |
| Pass your work to another Pod | `/tasks/handoff` |
| Search or update project files | `/memory/query`, `/memory/manage` |
| Report a bug or suggest a fix | `/system/manage_issues` |
| Check how well the AI reasoned | `/system/metrics` |
| Backfill project changelog | `/system/changelog` ‚Üí `validate` |

---

üß± **How the System Works**  
Each task, file, and issue is tracked in structured YAML files on GitHub.  
GPTs use these tools to read, write, and log their reasoning ‚Äî not just chat.  
Every output is traceable, auditable, and saved in version control.

---

üöÄ **What‚Äôs Coming Next?**

- ‚úÖ Auto-suggestions: GPT recommends next actions or tasks  
- üß† Better memory browsing: like a smart index of project ideas  
- ü™™ Roles and permissions: so Pods only see what they need  
- üìä More visual feedback: like dashboards for progress or performance  
- üìÅ Smarter file fetch: retrieve whole sections or prompt-ready summaries  

You‚Äôll be able to get more done, with less explaining, every time.

---

**What can you do with the tools?**  
You‚Äôre working with a smart AI delivery system. Each tool helps guide your project from start to finish. Here‚Äôs how to think about it:

üß† **Memory Tools**  
- Add or describe files using `/memory/manage`  
- Update or clean entries using `/memory/manage_entry`  
- Search the project knowledge base using `/memory/query`  

üìã **Task Tools**  
- Create, start, complete, or reopen tasks with `/tasks/lifecycle`  
- View all tasks or dependencies via `/tasks/query`  
- Clone or update tasks via `/tasks/manage_metadata`  

üîÅ **Collaboration + Workflow**  
- Use `/tasks/handoff` to pass work between teammates or Pods  
- Log thoughts or lessons with `/tasks/chain_of_thought`  
- Track your thought process with `/tasks/reasoning_trace`  

üîé **Support & Oversight**  
- Report bugs and ideas using `/system/manage_issues`  
- Check changelogs or backfill missing notes via `/system/changelog`  
- Analyze how well your team (or Pods) reasoned with `/system/metrics`  

üìÇ **Files and Project Setup**  
- Use `/system/fetch_files` to preview files  
- Start fresh with `/project/init_project`  
- Save results with `/tasks/commit_and_log_output`  

**Start with your goals:**  
- Want to begin a task? Use `lifecycle > start`  
- Need help from another Pod? Use `handoff > append`  
- Curious how reasoning went? Use `reasoning_trace > summary`

‚öôÔ∏è **Why These Tools Matter**  
In non-AI systems, developers wire up everything manually ‚Äî routes, logic, states.  
With plain ChatGPT or Custom GPTs, you're limited to ephemeral, stateless interactions.  
What‚Äôs missing?

‚úÖ Tool-based design bridges the gap between freeform LLMs and real-world system integration:
- Tools serve as contracted, versionable APIs to external systems (GitHub, memory, changelogs, metrics)
- Each route is discoverable by GPT, enabling autonomous action via `openapi.json`
- Actions are modular, parameterized, and state-aware (e.g., which task is in progress)

This lets us simulate a real AI-native SDLC, where Pods:
- Write and track tasks
- Share reasoning and artifacts
- Log bugs, changelogs, and system traces
- Evolve based on feedback, metrics, and dependencies

---

üß± **Technology Stack Overview**

- **FastAPI**: Backend API service with JSON-based OpenAPI routes  
- **GitHub + PyGitHub**: Source of truth for all project artifacts (`task.yaml`, `memory.yaml`, logs, etc.)  
- **Custom GPT + OpenAPI Spec**: Each Pod reads and writes via GPT + tool calls  
- **YAML**: All memory and metadata stored in Git-readable YAML, not databases  
- **In-memory routing**: Tools route requests by `mode` or `action`, enabling flexible consolidation  

**Example:**

```json
POST /tasks/lifecycle
{
  "action": "complete",
  "repo_name": "project-x",
  "task_id": "2.2",
  "outputs": [...],
  "reasoning_trace": {...}
}
```

This consolidates what used to be 7 separate routes into a maintainable, extensible schema.

| **Area**           | **Roadmap Ideas**                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tooling**        | Add dependency-aware auto-call logic, smarter retries, and fuzzy task lookups     |
| **Schema Management** | Dynamic OpenAPI generation based on repo structure                             |
| **Pod Reasoning**  | Fine-tune prompt templates per action for better behavior                         |
| **Testing**        | Auto-generate test suites from schema definitions and example payloads            |
| **Memory/Context** | Integrate vector-based retrieval with YAML index fallback                         |
| **Monitoring**     | Add audit routes for GPT tool call stats, failure types, reasoning metrics        |
