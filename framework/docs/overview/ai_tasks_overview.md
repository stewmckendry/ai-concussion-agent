## ✅ Task Management in the AI Delivery Framework

---

### 🔧 For Technical Users

In the AI-native delivery framework, `task.yaml` is your source of truth for all planned, active, and completed work. Each task is tracked with:

- **task_id**: Unique identifier (e.g., `2.1_write_data_model`)
- **phase**: Which stage of the SDLC it belongs to
- **pod_owner**: The GPT Pod or human role responsible
- **inputs and outputs**: Referenced files
- **status**: `unassigned`, `planned`, `in_progress`, `completed`
- **depends_on**: List of prerequisite task IDs
- **handoff_from**: Which task handed it off
- **prompt**: Path to the prompt template

---

### 🧠 How Tasks Work

- GPTs or humans start a task using `/tasks/start`, log thoughts, and complete it
- Reasoning and decision history is stored in:
  - `prompt_used.txt`
  - `chain_of_thought.yaml`
  - `reasoning_trace.yaml`
- All task actions are versioned in Git and summarized in `changelog.yaml`

| POST `/tasks/auto_handoff`| Link one task to the next with reasoning          |

> Tasks power **traceability**, **reproducibility**, and **explainability** — even across GPTs.

### 🧩 For Non-Technical Users

Think of a task like a **smart sticky note** that tracks:

- What’s being done  
- Who’s doing it (human or GPT)  
- What files it uses or creates  
- Why decisions were made  

Every task lives in a big checklist (`task.yaml`) that helps GPTs and people work together. Each one includes:

- What **phase** it’s in (like Discovery or Testing)  
- Who **owns** it (like DevPod or ProductPod)  
- What came **before** (dependencies)  
- What comes **next** (handoffs)  

---

### 🛠️ What You Can Do

- Ask “**what tasks are left?**” → the system will show planned work  
- Click a task to **start it** → the system loads its prompt and prior context  
- When done, just **submit the result** → it logs reasoning and moves to the next  

The system can even:
- Suggest the **next task automatically**
- Pass work between **pods**
- **Explain why** decisions were made

---

### ✅ Task Management Makes AI Delivery:
- **Organized**
- **Transparent**
- **Easy to follow for everyone**

## ✅ Task Management in the AI Delivery Framework (Updated)

---

### 🧠 For Technical Users

In AI-native delivery, `task.yaml` is your **structured backlog** — versioned, queryable, and auto-linked to prompts, files, and reasoning.  
Each task contains:

- `task_id`: Unique identifier (e.g. `2.2_build_api`)
- `phase`: SDLC stage (Discovery, Development, etc.)
- `pod_owner`: Who owns it (e.g. DevPod)
- `inputs / outputs`: Referenced file paths
- `depends_on`: Upstream task IDs
- `handoff_from`: ID of task that handed off to this one
- `status`: `unassigned`, `planned`, `in_progress`, `completed`

Every tool call, prompt, and thought is **anchored to a task** — making the system fully auditable.

### 🔁 Workflow Architecture

- All artifacts live in a **versioned Git repo** (files, prompts, memory, reasoning)
- Every tool call is **exposed via REST API** and indexed in logs
- GPTs operate in **Pods**, invoking APIs like `start_task`, `commit_output`, `auto_handoff`

This makes the system:

✅ **Auditable**  
✅ **Modular**  
✅ **GPT-native**  
✅ **Developer-friendly**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

---

### 🧠 For Technical Users

The AI-native delivery system is built to evolve. Here are key areas under exploration to extend its capabilities:

---

#### 🔗 1. Workflow Automation (LangChain, DSPy, etc.)
Use frameworks like **LangChain**, **DSPy**, or **CrewAI** to define full workflows where tasks are **automatically chained** based on outputs.  
Each GPT Pod becomes an **agent** in a graph of actions — from prompt execution to follow-up task creation and handoff.

---

#### 🧰 2. Domain-Agnostic Task Modeling
Tasks aren’t just for software delivery — the system can be reused for:
- ERP processes (e.g. procurement-to-pay)
- CRM automation (e.g. lead triage)
- EMR workflows (e.g. clinical intake → summary generation)

> ✅ We'll introduce **customizable task templates** for these domains.

---

#### 🧠 3. Semantic Planning & Task Generation
Use GPT to **auto-generate task lists** from a single goal (e.g., "Launch new feature" → creates 10 tasks with dependencies).  
- Validate task DAGs using embeddings, schemas, or knowledge graphs.

---

#### 🔁 4. Dynamic Pod Routing
Tasks will be dynamically routed to the best-fit GPT Pod based on:
- `phase`
- `category`
- `context window`
- `skill profile`

> 🧠 Enables **multi-agent orchestration** without manual pod mapping.

---

#### 🧮 5. Reasoning Metrics + Continuous Improvement
Extend `reasoning_trace.yaml` to compute:
- Thought impact score
- Redundancy vs. novelty ratio
- Missed tool opportunities

> 🔄 Enables **automated prompt refinement** and feedback loops.

---

### 🤝 For Non-Technical Users

We’re building this system so it can grow with your needs — no matter your industry or role. Here’s what’s coming:

---

#### 🔁 Smarter Task Flows
Soon, the system will **auto-create tasks from a goal**, like:

> “Improve onboarding experience”  
> 🧠 It will build a plan with steps, owners, and handoffs.

---

#### 🧩 More Than Software Projects
We’re working on templates for:
- Government service improvement
- Healthcare records and triage
- HR onboarding and policy updates
- Marketing campaign tracking

> ♻️ Reuse the same logic for **any structured workflow**.

---

#### 🤖 Personalized GPTs per Team
Each team (Dev, QA, PM, Ops) will have its own GPT assistant trained on:
- Your past tasks
- Your decision patterns
- Your domain vocabulary

---

#### 📊 Better Guidance and Dashboards
We're adding smarter insights like:
- What tasks are slowing us down?
- Where did GPT struggle?
- What should I do next?
