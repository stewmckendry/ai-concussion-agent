Of course! Here’s the **Pod Playbook in clean `.md` format** — ready to copy or drop into your repo.

# AI-Native Pod Playbook

*A modular system for delivering software with AI agents and human orchestration*

---

## 1. Pod Overview

| Pod Type     | Role |
|--------------|------|
| **Dev Pod**  | Builds product features, flows, APIs, data handling, prompt integration |
| **QA Pod**   | Designs validation plans, tests model outputs, checks response structure, logs failures |
| **Research Pod** | Performs spikes, benchmarks tools, summarizes external knowledge |
| **WoW Pod**  | Defines delivery rituals, logs system activity, tracks metrics, evolves tooling |
| **Infra Pod** *(optional)* | Builds deployment scripts, manages repos, supports containerization |
| **Human Lead** | Assigns tasks, runs integration scripts, reviews cross-pod conflicts or escalations |

---

## 2. Pod Contracts (Interface Definition)

Use structured task files to ensure pods operate autonomously.  
Define contracts in `tasks/{pod_name}/task_XXX.yaml`:

```yaml
task_id: task_004_validate_stage_logic
assigned_to: qa_pod
depends_on: dev_pod_1.task_003_stage_flow
input:
  - src/models/concussion_agent.py
  - src/utils/load_flow.py
expected_output:
  - test_stage_flow.py
  - trace.log
validation:
  - must_cover_all_flow_stages
  - use_fixture: test_fixtures/stage_inputs.json
  - log: trace.log
```

---

## 3. Pod Memory System

| File                | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| `brief.md`           | Summarizes the current task, with links to prior work |
| `trace.log`          | Captures AI pod's reasoning, decisions, and uncertainties |
| `pod_history.yaml`   | Accumulates past task summaries, key contributions, and known limitations |
| `changelog.md`       | Plain-language summary of what's changed and why |

These allow stateless pods (ChatGPT) to retain context over time.

---

## 4. Drift Detection + Correction

Use the WoW pod to run regular drift checks:

- `drift_scan.py` weekly to:
  - Detect overlapping file ownership
  - Flag outdated pod memory files
  - Highlight orphaned or untested code

- Tag each PR with labels:
  - `#dev-prompt`, `#qa-coverage`, `#infra`, `#model-logic`

- Maintain a `pods.yaml` registry for pod-to-file mappings.

---

## 5. Pod Lifecycle: Split / Merge / Orchestrate

| Signal | Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Pod backlog diverging in themes | **Split** | Competing missions inside one pod |
| Multiple pods editing same files | **Merge or Add Contract** | Reduce friction and duplication |
| Pod has no active tasks | **Merge or Sunset** | Clean up inactive pods |
| Complex cross-pod logic | **Add Orchestrator (Human or Bot)** | Enable clear handoff and escalation |

---

## 6. WoW Pod Rituals

The **Ways of Working Pod** owns the delivery system:

- Logs metrics to: `logs/pods/wow_pod/metrics.yaml`
- Maintains: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`
- Runs: `drift_scan.py`, PR label checks, trace validation
- Labels PRs for traceability
- Recommends delivery improvements every 2–4 cycles

---

## 7. Metrics to Track

| Metric                         | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| PRs per week per pod           | Flow and activity health |
| Time from task → PR            | Pod responsiveness |
| Validation success rate        | Output quality |
| Trace logs per PR              | Auditability |
| File coverage by pod type      | Balance or redundancy issues |
| Manual escalations per sprint  | Coordination issues |

Let me know if you’d like to:
- Add this to your GitHub repo directly
- Generate the `drift_scan.py` stub
- Create companion files (`WORKFLOW.md`, `pods.yaml`, etc.) to round out the toolkit

We’re building something amazing here!
