# 📓 AI-Native Delivery Framework: Phase 2 Enhancements (April 2025)

## 📊 Purpose

This document captures the next evolution of the AI-Native Delivery System, focused on reducing friction, improving traceability, and accelerating project execution for the NHL Predictor PoC and future AI-native projects.

The goal is to build upon the strong foundations already in place, enhancing the system to be more seamless, automated, repeatable, and auditable.

# 🔢 Why Are We Enhancing the Framework?

| Problem | Impact |
|:--------|:-------|
| Too many manual steps | Slows delivery, introduces errors |
| Rigid promote_patch after every micro-task | Overhead, no batching |
| Fragile prompt handling | Blockers when prompts missing |
| Poor chain-of-thought capture | No visibility into how Pods reasoned |
| Manual reasoning traces and handoffs | High human burden |
| Risky memory.yaml drift | Sync issues without structure |


---

# ✨ Future State Vision

| Area | Future Behavior | Outcome |
|:-----|:----------------|:--------|
| Task execution | Activate → auto-update → auto-commit | Fast, fluid task progress |
| Prompt management | Auto-draft prompts, auto-store and commit prompts | No blockers, full traceability |
| Reasoning trace | Auto-generate reasoning aligned with metrics framework | Full auditability, structured reasoning |
| Git commits | Auto-commit major lifecycle updates | Clean history, no micromanagement |
| Promote_patch | Batch promote only meaningful milestones | Strategic, lightweight promotions |
| Chain of Thought | Append reasoning evolution automatically | Human-AI collaboration visible |
| Changelog | Central CHANGELOG.md updated automatically | Clear audit trails |
| Handoff notes | Auto-generate and appendable per task | Seamless Pod transitions |
| Metrics | Integrated reasoning capture, CoT linkage | Improved system learning |
| Project initialization | Repo setup + framework standardization automated | Fast, consistent starting point |

# 🔧 Implementation Plan

## 📊 New FastAPI Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `/project/init_project` | Create + initialize new project repo |
| `/tasks/append_chain_of_thought/{task_id}` | Append to chain of thought file |
| `/tasks/auto_commit/{task_id}` | Auto-commit minor updates to Git |
| `/tasks/append_handoff_note/{task_id}` | Append or create handoff note |
| `/tasks/append_changelog` | Auto-update CHANGELOG.md entries |


## 📊 OpenAPI Schema Updates

- `/tasks/activate` → Document smart prompt fallback
- Add schemas for new endpoints above
- Confirm promote_patch aligns to new batch promotion logic


## 📊 New Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| `scripts/structure_repo.py` | Set up repo scaffolding for projects |
| `scripts/auto_commit.py` | Auto-commit minor updates |
| `scripts/append_chain_of_thought.py` | Append step notes to chain of thought files |
| `scripts/append_handoff_note.py` | Auto-create or update handoff notes |
| `scripts/append_changelog.py` | Add structured entries to CHANGELOG.md |


## 📊 Prompt and Template Updates

| Item | Change |
|:-----|:------|
| DeliveryPod system prompt | Auto-call append_chain_of_thought at key events |
| Project templates | Add `/outputs/`, `/scripts/`, `/templates/` directories |
| Reasoning trace | Align with structured format for metrics capture |


## 📊 Memory.yaml / Task.yaml Updates

- Link `prompt_used.txt`, `reasoning_trace.md`, `cot.md`, and `handoff.md` to each task if available
- Track `project_init_trace` for project initialization steps


## 📊 Auto-Commit Logic

| Event | Auto-Commit? |
|:------|:------------|
| Task activated | ✅ |
| Task completed | ✅ |
| Prompt drafted due to missing file | ✅ |
| Reasoning trace updated | ✅ |
| Chain of thought appended | ✅ |
| Handoff note updated | ✅ |
| Minor metadata tweak | ❌ (batch later)


## 📊 Chain of Thought Capture

- Chain of thought file `/outputs/task_updates/{task_id}/cot_{task_id}.md`
- Appended automatically at key reasoning events (activation, updates, pivots)


## 📊 Prompt Management

- Auto-draft missing prompts during `/tasks/activate`
- Auto-save prompts to correct path and commit
- Link prompt to memory.yaml


## 📊 Reasoning Trace Management

- Auto-generate reasoning trace aligned with metrics framework
- Use chain of thought log to enrich reasoning trace
- Save under `/outputs/task_updates/{task_id}/reasoning_trace.md`


## 📊 Changelog Management

- Central `CHANGELOG.md` updated automatically
- Every tool that commits changes will also append a structured entry to the changelog.
- Avoid using separate explicit API calls; integrate changelog updates directly into tool handlers for best practice.


## 📊 Handoff Notes

- Auto-generate `.logs/handoff/{task_id}_handoff.md` per task
- Allow appending via GPT or Human Lead
- Linked optionally in memory.yaml


## 📊 Promote_Patch Best Practices

- Human Lead triggers promote_patch after logical milestones (e.g., finish Discovery Phase)
- promote_patch bundles updates, generates changelog, and creates PR


## 📊 Auto-Commit Upgrades to Existing Routes

| Route | Enhancement |
|:------|:------------|
| `/tasks/activate` | After updating task status, save prompt if missing, auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/create` | After creating new task, auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/update_metadata/{task_id}` | If significant fields updated (done, prompt, etc.), auto-commit `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/tasks/clone` | After cloning, auto-commit updated `task.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/memory/index` | After reindexing, auto-commit `memory.yaml`, append to changelog |
| `/memory/add` | After adding new memory entries, auto-commit `memory.yaml`, append to changelog |

# 🚀 End-to-End Examples

## A) Project Initialization
**Human Lead:**
- Triggers `/project/init_project` with repo details and project metadata.

**GPT Pod Tools:**
- Scaffold repo structure.
- Fetch or create `task.yaml` and `memory.yaml`.
- Capture and save initial prompt and reasoning.
- Auto-commit to GitHub (`chatgpt/auto/init_project`).


## B) Discovery Tasks (1.1 Capture Goals, 1.2 User Flows)
**GPT Pod:**
- Calls `/tasks/activate` for each task.
- Auto-drafts missing prompt if needed.
- Captures prompt_used.txt, reasoning_trace.md, and appends to cot.md.
- Auto-commits "in_progress" and "done" status changes.

**Human Lead:**
- Monitors Pod output.
- Optionally reviews and updates drafts.
- After multiple tasks complete, calls `promote_patch` manually to formalize batch updates.


## C) Development Tasks (2.1 Design, 2.2 Build Feature)
**GPT Pod:**
- Activates each development task via `/tasks/activate`.
- Produces designs, code, documentation.
- Captures full prompt/reasoning trace automatically.
- Auto-commits after meaningful deliverables.

**Human Lead:**
- Reviews outputs as needed.
- Ensures logical batches (e.g., full feature) before triggering `promote_patch`.

# 🔧 Thoughts and Confirmations

✅ This model will:
- Implement foundational enhancements progressively.
- Test practical flows after each major functional upgrade.
- Deliver both the framework AND the NHL PoC app working seamlessly.

✅ Every major SDLC phase will be tested and verified before moving forward.

✅ Risk is minimized by validating at each phase rather than all at once.
