## 🧩 Technical Tools & Automation Status

| Component                     | Status   | Notes |
|------------------------------|----------|-------|

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Slack/email notification when PR opened
- [ ] Auto-generate markdown changelog from YAML
- [ ] Add unit tests to validate patch + log format
- [ ] `.podrc.yaml` to configure pod task + input files
- [ ] Enable multi-pod chain: research → design → build
