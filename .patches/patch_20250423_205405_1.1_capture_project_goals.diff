+# Project Goals: Atlas Knowledge Network (Draft)
+
+## 🎯 Mission
+
+To build an open, decentralized platform that empowers communities to create, share, and evolve structured knowledge using AI and human collaboration.
+
+## 💡 Purpose
+
+Atlas aims to solve the fragmentation of knowledge across documents, teams, and platforms by creating a living, evolving knowledge graph that is:
+- **Community-driven**: Every node can be proposed, refined, or challenged by contributors.
+- **AI-augmented**: Uses LLMs to recommend links, summarize debates, and clarify contradictions.
+- **Structured yet flexible**: Supports both formal logic and soft insights.
+
+## 🔑 Key Outcomes
+
+- A working prototype that visualizes live debates and thought trails
+- A GPT-powered “Knowledge Steward” that helps maintain integrity of the graph
+- A successful pilot with a civic tech community or university
+
+## 👥 Audience
+
+This platform is primarily designed for **researchers** who want to collaboratively explore and structure ideas over time.
+
+## 🤝 Contribution Model
+
+Participants will contribute to a **shared content management system** that tracks structured claims, revisions, and community-sourced refinements.
+
+## 🔌 Interoperability
+
+Yes — Atlas will integrate with external forums, documents, and chat platforms to support cross-platform knowledge workflows.
+
+## 📈 KPIs
+
+- 5 communities onboarded  
+- 1000+ concepts captured and linked  
+- 90% user satisfaction with AI reasoning and suggestions
