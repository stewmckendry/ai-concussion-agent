# ✅ AI-Native Delivery Progress Checklist

# ✅ AI-Native Delivery Progress Tracker

This document tracks the status of implementation across AI-native delivery workflows — from patch generation to pod handoff to GitHub PR automation.

---

## 📦 Patch Contribution Flow (generate_patch.py)

### ✅ Done
- `generate_patch.py` supports:
  - Validating staged files
  - Detecting merge conflict risks
  - Logging to `.logs/handoff_log.yaml`
  - Autopromote to GitHub via PR (calls `create_pr_from_patch.sh`)
- `create_pr_from_patch.sh` fully rewired:
  - Fetches latest main
  - Reuses or creates patch branches
  - Detects triggered patch from GitHub Action
  - Auto-cleans patch file after apply
- GitHub Action `.github/workflows/promote_patch.yaml` auto-triggers PRs on `.patches/*.diff`
- Conflict resolution script `resolve_merge_conflicts.sh` drafted
- Clear merge-safe process defined (don’t pre-stage patch files!)
- Glossary and instructions documented in [AI Native Generate Patch Guide](./ai_native_generate_patch.md)

### 🛠️ To Do
- [ ] Finalize `copy_patch_to_repo.py` to move outputs from ChatGPT sandbox into local repo `.patches/`
- [ ] Enhance `generate_patch.py` to support tagging pods + destination paths
- [ ] Add validation that paths exist before patching
- [ ] Auto-resolve trivial merge conflicts if safe
- [ ] Write `sync_downstream_branch.sh` to keep patch branches fresh
- [ ] Automatically mark PR as approved when human merges
- [ ] Document how `generate_patch.py` integrates with pod workflows and `memory.yaml`

---

## 🧠 AI Operating System

### ✅ Done
- [x] Memory structure defined: `memory.yaml`, `task.yaml`, markdown guides, logs
- [x] Phase-based flow (Discovery → Dev → QA → Ship) aligned across tools
- [x] Role clarity between ChatGPT pods and Human Lead
- [x] Structured prompt format aligned with pod tasking
- [x] Logs for `thought_trace.yaml`, `handoff_log.yaml` auto-populated
- [x] GitHub PR auto-generation confirmed working for ChatGPT-delivered patches

### 🛠️ To Do
- [ ] Enable `task.yaml` as input to `generate_patch.py`
- [ ] Auto-tag PRs with task/phase metadata
- [ ] Expand `memory.yaml` to link active files + doc purpose
- [ ] Script to view open handoffs by phase (pending merge)
- [ ] Explore memory strategies: dynamic markdown memory, Git-traceable file references, and vector DB for task recall

---

## 🧱 Project Repo Structure

### ✅ Done
- [x] Repo structured with `/src`, `/docs`, `/scripts`, `/notebooks`, `.patches`, `.logs`
- [x] PoD outputs placed correctly (code → `src/`, research → `docs/`, etc.)
- [x] Repo upkeep guide written: [Repo Structure Guide](./repo_structure_upkeep_guide.md)
- [x] Patch-based file routing confirmed working (via `create_pr_from_patch.sh`)

### 🛠️ To Do
- [ ] Add `scripts/copy_patch_to_repo.py` to move PoD outputs → .patches
- [ ] Enable PoD prompts to dynamically pull active task file links from `memory.yaml`
- [ ] Draft a “repo onboarding guide” for new contributors

---

## 🪛 Utilities & Dev Scripts

### ✅ Done
- [x] `resolve_merge_conflicts.sh` created for local troubleshooting
- [x] `create_pr_from_patch.sh` CI-safe and human-safe
- [x] Scripts validated across multiple patch runs with GitHub PRs

### 🛠️ To Do
- [ ] `reset_git_state.sh` to reset all patch branches and unstaged files
- [ ] `patch_cleanup.sh` to delete old `.patches/*.diff` + branches
- [ ] `approve_patch.sh` to mark PR as reviewed and merged

---

## 🔄 Collaboration Flow

### ✅ Done
- [x] Human can still push directly to `main` (non `.patches` files)
- [x] Patches created by ChatGPT pods, reviewed by human in PR
- [x] PR workflow clarified in `AI Native Patch Guide`
- [x] Local editing process confirmed safe (avoid git add for PoD file paths)
- [x] Merge conflict prevention logic working in `generate_patch.py`

### 🛠️ To Do
- [ ] Write full `copy_patch_to_repo.py` handoff script
- [ ] Add GitHub Action to validate patch content format
- [ ] Add warning if PR patch branch already exists

This checklist tracks the progress of implementing an AI-native delivery model using ChatGPT Pods and GitHub automation as defined in the [AI Native Workflow Guide](../docs/ai-delivery-kit/AI%20Native%20Workflow%20Guide.md).

---

## 🧠 PHASE 1: Assign Work to Pod

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1.1  | Assign clear task and target file(s)               | ✅ Done manually via prompt |
| 1.2  | Include inputs, constraints, and goals             | ✅ Manual in prompt |
| 1.3  | Provide GitHub links to latest source files        | ✅ Included in prompt |

---

## 🤖 PHASE 2: Pod Does Work

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2.1  | Make changes to one or more files                  | ✅ Via prompt or internal logic |
| 2.2  | Run `generate_patch.py`                            | ✅ Operational |
| 2.3  | Save patch and logs to `.patches/` and `.logs/`    | ✅ Working |
| 2.4  | Set `--autopromote` to auto-branch + PR            | ✅ Integrated |
| 2.5  | Create feature branch and push to GitHub           | ✅ Works with GitHub CLI and GH Actions |

---

## 🔄 PHASE 3: Review and Merge

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 3.1  | Notify human to review PR                         | ✅ Manual or via PR link |
| 3.2  | View diff, changelog, and thought trace logs       | ✅ Auto-included |
| 3.3  | Approve and merge into `main`                      | ⚠️ Sometimes blocked due to permissions |

---

## 📦 PHASE 4: Handoff and Next Pod

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 4.1  | Merged patch updates files + logs in repo         | ✅ Confirmed |
| 4.2  | Another pod can read the updated repo             | ✅ Ready for chain workflows |
| 4.3  | GitHub history and logs trace full lineage        | ✅ Working |
| 4.4  | Artifacts stored in `.logs/`, `.patches/`, `.md`  | ✅ Structured logs present |

| `generate_patch.py`          | ✅ Done   | Autopromote, logging, tags |
| `create_pr_from_patch.sh`    | ✅ Done   | Branch handling + PR creation |
| `.github/workflows/*.yaml`   | ✅ Done   | Trigger PR from .diff upload |
| GitHub CLI support (local)   | ✅ Done   | Used for local PR push |

- [ ] Auto-generate markdown changelog from YAML
- [ ] Add unit tests to validate patch + log format
- [ ] `.podrc.yaml` to configure pod task + input files
- [ ] Enable multi-pod chain: research → design → build
