# AI-Native Delivery System: Concussion Agent Pods

Welcome to an AI-native delivery system where **each pod is an autonomous ChatGPT agent**, working alongside a human orchestrator to build, test, and ship AI-powered applications ‚Äî fast, traceably, and safely.

This repo powers the **Concussion Agent App**, using a fully modular and auditable ChatGPT-pod-based workflow.

---

## üß† System Overview

**Pod-based AI delivery** replaces traditional teams with focused, AI-powered agents (pods). Each pod specializes in a capability area and works via structured input/output tasks, coordinated through Git and shell scripts.

**Components:**
- **Dev Pod 1**: Builds core app logic + flow (e.g., assessment stages, YAML validation)
- **Dev Pod 2**: Develops prompts, reasoning trace, LLM structure, and supporting infrastructure
- **QA Pod**: Designs and runs tests (logic, hallucination, response format, model behavior)
- **Research Pod**: Explores external tools, designs experiments, refines reasoning approaches
- **WoW Pod**: Defines ways of working, tracks pod metrics, generates changelogs and trace logs
- **Human Lead**: Runs orchestration scripts, integrates pod outputs, resolves conflicts
- **Shared GitHub Repo**: Source of truth for pod outputs, tracked commits, and system state

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Assign a Task
Each task is defined in a `tasks/{pod_name}/{task_id}.yaml` file with:
- Input context (brief, data, goal)
- Output schema or file expectations
- Validation or test requirements

### 2. Run a Pod
Use `run-pod.sh` or similar script to:
- Load pod system prompt + task context
- Capture and validate ChatGPT output
- Stage result files (code, markdown, test cases)
- Commit with trace logs

### 3. Review & Merge
- Pod outputs are submitted as PRs with:
  - `trace.log` of how/why changes were made
  - `patch.diff` or updated files
  - Labels (e.g., `dev-pod`, `qa-validated`)
- Human Lead reviews, tests, and merges to `main`

## üõ°Ô∏è Contribution Guidelines (for Pods)

Each pod must:
- Follow input/output format specs
- Include a `trace.log` explaining reasoning
- Pass validation (output checks, unit tests)
- Update `changelog.md` and/or `metrics.yaml` if applicable

Human Lead will:
- Resolve ambiguous outputs
- Coordinate across pods
- Integrate final changes via PR

---

## üìä Metrics & Traceability

The WoW pod tracks:
- PR frequency + latency
- Pod contribution stats
- Output format adherence
- Failed validations or test coverage

Each PR includes:
- A `trace.log` of the thought process
- Output files and/or `patch.diff`
- Pod name + task ID for full lineage

---

## ‚úÖ Getting Started

To run a pod on a new task:
```bash
bash scripts/run-pod.sh dev_pod_1 tasks/dev_pod_1/task_001_logic_flow.yaml
```

To validate a pod‚Äôs output:
```bash
bash scripts/validate-output.sh logs/pods/dev_pod_1/output_001.json
```

To sync approved output to `main`:
```bash
bash scripts/sync-to-main.sh
```
