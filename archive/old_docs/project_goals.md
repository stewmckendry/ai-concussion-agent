# Project Goals: LlamaExpress 🚀

## 🎯 Mission

Deliver modular AI-native knowledge patches through Llama expressions – whether on Earth or in orbit.

## 💡 Purpose

Replace brittle decision logic with reusable, composable Llama expressions that power:
- Patch-based automation
- Delivery across planetary boundaries
- Structured collaboration between humans and AIs

## 🛰 Goals

### 1. Launch Llamas into Low Earth Orbit
- **why:** Demonstrates logic portability
- **success:** One working Llama expression guiding orbital delivery

### 2. Interplanetary Delivery in <48h
- **why:** Mars deserves better service
- **success:** No Martian complaints. Not even from Jeff.

### 3. Space-Grade Saddlepacks
- **why:** Secure patch packaging
- **success:** Packs certified for weightlessness

### 4. Zero-G Navigation for Llamas
- **why:** Autonomy in space
- **success:** Moonwalking Llamas, literate in microgravity

### 5. Join Galactic Trade Alliance
- **why:** Legalize exports
- **success:** Diplomatic creds + Netflix deal

## ❓ Gaps to Resolve (Now with Fun Fixes)

- ✅ Fallback delivery method in orbit: Deploy the "Patch-a-chute" — a micro-parachute that delivers expressions to targeted lunar mailboxes.
- ✅ Synchronizing Llama logic with gravity wells: Introduce the "Gravimapper-9000," a snack-powered sensor that aligns decision graphs with local spacetime curvature.
- ✅ Galactic fuzz tolerance: Default to "Quantum Cozy" — a tolerance zone where patches auto-fuzz if planetary politics get spicy.

Fluff on, forward, and into the stars. 🌌
