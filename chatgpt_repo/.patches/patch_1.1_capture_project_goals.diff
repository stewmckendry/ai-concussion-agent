-# Project Goals (Draft)
-
-We want to use AI to speed up delivery cycles and reduce human bottlenecks. The system should support patch-based thinking and help teams work more asynchronously.
-
-Some goals we've mentioned in past meetings:
-- Make it easy for ChatGPT to suggest changes and improvements
-- Enable human reviewers to see what's changing and why
-- Help people trust AI-generated contributions
-
-> Note: These were rough notes. This doc needs structure and clarity.
+# Project Goals
+
+This project explores how AI-native delivery can use modular agents and memory-aware tools to generate reusable developer outputs like tests, patches, and summaries.
+
+## Goals
+
+### 1. Reusable Templates
+Standardize tasks and memory formats to enable reuse across multiple agent pods.
+
+- **Why it matters**: Reduces duplication and speeds up pod creation.
+- **Success**: Templates used in multiple pods or GitHub repos.
+- **KPI**: 
+  - At least 5 reusable templates published
+  - Templates adopted in 3+ active pods
+
+### 2. Dynamic Agent Execution
+Enable agents to reason over GitHub context (tasks, memory) to autonomously complete development tasks.
+
+- **Why it matters**: Automates context gathering and reduces coordination needs.
+- **Success**: Agent completes full dev task based on memory/task files.
+- **KPI**:
+  - At least 3 end-to-end tasks executed without manual input
+  - >80% task completion accuracy from GitHub memory input
+
+### 3. Useful Output Generation
+Generate patches, tests, and summaries that can be used in real-world developer workflows.
+
+- **Why it matters**: Outputs should be practical, not just theoretical.
+- **Success**: Outputs integrated into pull requests and reviews.
+- **KPI**:
+  - 10+ generated test/patch files used in PRs
+  - 2+ external contributors use generated outputs
+
+### 4. Cognitive Load & Time Reduction
+Demonstrate measurable improvements in engineering delivery time and mental load.
+
+- **Why it matters**: Improve dev experience and efficiency with AI-native workflows.
+- **Success**: Shorter cycle times, better focus.
+- **KPI**:
+  - 25% reduction in time-to-deliver tasks (vs baseline)
+  - Qualitative feedback from 3+ users reporting reduced mental friction
